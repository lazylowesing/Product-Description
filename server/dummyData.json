            "text": "I'm glad they came out with this because I enjoy using the other Kobalt screwdrivers. I have a multi-bit screwdriver that has the same handle shape as this and I've wanted to get more. You can tell that these are a bit cheaper than the nice bigger sets Kobalt currently also retails. What I'm talking about is the blue grip on the screwdrivers themselves having less grip pattern on it, lacking the hex/scaling entirely. That really added a nice touch on the previous drivers in my opinion. What is nice though is the hanging loop at the top which can also be used for extra torque by inserting another screwdriver and making a \"T shape\" handle. The precision screwdrivers also feel a bit cheaper than what you'll get with the dark blue Kobalt precision set (The one with the hardcase). These in comparison have very loose end caps and don't have the bright markings to indicate which is which. I'll be keeping this set as my easy-reach set for small things, while keeping my other ones in the workshop area for bigger projects.",
