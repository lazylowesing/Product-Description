Hammer time!  We ordered a bargain hammer online but when we went to pick it up we found this heavier one for just a dollar more.  It was sturdy, light (we are no marines) high quality, perfect for our simple job and less than ten dollars.  With the right tool we saved the $400 a new door would have cost and now we can use the storm door and let air in without bees coming in too!",
