        "overview": "Winner of the popular mechanics editor's choice award and the retailers' choice award of distinction, the Speedlite® Square is an all-around crowd pleaser. This Square is an 8 in. lightweight version of the Swanson® speed® Square, first developed by company founder Albert Swanson in 1925. The innovative Speedlite® Square is everything you know and love about the speed® Square, but it’s especially great for use with siding and other delicate materials, since it won’t mar soft finishes. This innovative tool combines 5 tools into 1: 1. Try Square, 2. Miter Square, 3. Saw guide, 4. Line scriber, and 5. protractor. This model is constructed of lightweight, high-impact composite and is available in gray and high-visibility orange, and high-visibility yellow. The Speedlite® Square also includes markings for using the Swanson® one-number® method of rafter layout. The Swanson® Speed® Square is our most popular product and remains the most trusted Square of its kind. Look for the Diamond® cutout for genuine Swanson® products.",

A year or so ago, I dropped it and broke off about ½ inch of one point. No big deal. This morning, I noticed a crack both ways across the diamond hole. It's given a lot of excellent service, and has lasted longer than I would have expected from plastic. I'm on the site right now checking out the aluminum version for my next purchase. It should outlast me! That said, the plastic one is a great value for more limited use.",
