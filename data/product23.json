            "text": "We bought this set for use on an uncovered patio. I like the idea of being able to move it around and change configurations which you cannot do with most outdoor sectionals. Placing the order was easy and the items came all assembled which is a plus. Problem was the back most corner leg of the corner piece was broken in transit. I called and got a Garden Treasures rep who was just NOT interested in talking to me. She kept talking over me and insisted she knew what I wanted. Week later I get a connector piece in the mail which is NOT what I needed. Call again and speak to someone else. They understand what I need but tell me I will be getting a whole new corner seat. They don't have just the piece that fits into the leg. OK, that seems stupid. While waiting on piece the set is sitting outside in our thunderstorm weather in FL. It is starting to RUST. For an outdoor piece this is unacceptable. I had a set I sold sitting in the same place for 4 years that never rusted. I now have bought 2 covers to go over the set. Yesterday I received the new corner and it looks OK. Now I have to dispose of the broken one. Not sure what I'm going to do about the rust. Maybe polyurethane the pieces?",

I purchased 3 of them to setup around 2 fire pit tables but im now worried about the life span of these seats after reading reviews of rusting frames and moldy cushions.Is rust and mold covered under the warranty!

Assembly was a little challenging with pre drilled holes misaligned. But customer service was EXCELLENT. They were responsive and shipped replacement pieces without a fuss or any additional costs. Reading other reviews I was shocked that people would expose their set to the elements and then expect nothing to happen to it. We keep our set covered daily when not in use and bring it indoors during the winter months. We also treated the legs with wax to prevent rust and spray annually with UV and rain protectant.  Our set still looks brand new out of the box. We highly recommend this set and will be purchasing 2 ottomans this year to complete the look.",

Bought 2 extra matching ottomams (talk to Dept. sales rep in store)to lengthen one side and to have a coffee table/foot rest. Quality is OK and I don't understand one star rating seam splitting comments. We have seen none of that. Our set is in the shade so maybe there's a UV problem with the stitching (fabric supposed to be UV protected). Seat cushions are a little thin for a big person after a while.

In fact, my husband and I take naps on it and the kids can never find us (I mean, who takes naps outside?!)

There really is no assembly (assembly being the biggest problem I noted in reviews of many other sets.). I have two seat actions more than I need for very happy!less money and can use them as extra unattached seating.

This piece easily accommodates 5 large adults and is easy to get up and down from.  So far we have noticed no materials drying out in the heat and expect to get several years out of this set.  I would like to see a choice in colors of the cushions -- tan is what comes in the box.  This can be remedied by purchasing additional cushions, but would have been nice for an option.  Overall a very good choice for sturdy outdoor furniture that looks great and is extremely comfortable.",
