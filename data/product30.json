When you purchase this pump, PURCHASE a B&K BRASS 3/4\" Threaded Male x FIP Hose Adapter (Lowes Item # 877058) and a small roll of teflon tape to replace the plastic hose adapter that comes with the pump which failed within 1 hour of pumping. I constructed a small floating basket (small holes in sides) with a large pool noodle (for buoyancy) and wire-ties to prevent the debris from clogging the pump. (SEE PHOTO) WORKED LIKE A CHARM !!! Completely drained the pool in less than 20 hours !!!",
