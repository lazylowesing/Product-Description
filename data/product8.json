            "text": "I just have a small yard, so a reliable push mower is all I need. I have had great luck with Briggs and Stratton engines in the past. Plus, Craftsman still make decent products. I have used it twice now and it cuts well, starts right up, the wheel adjustment levers are easy to use, and the bag comes on and off with ease. My only gripe is that mine came without an oil fill cap. I called the store, they were very apologetic and told me just to come back with the receipt and they'd give me one. That's what I did without an issue. Overall a great experience, but 4 stars for the missing part. The store staff all get 5 stars for being so friendly and helpful.",

It says \"some assembly required\" but it consists of just loosening some fasteners, pulling up the handlebar, and re-tightening fasteners & attaching grass bag, if you want to use it. Our yard was the bane of the neighborhood and the weeds were three feet high and thick. This went through them like a dream. What a great purchase. I had a fantastic photo of the 3ft tall weeds next to the mowed/cleared section with the mower, but Lowes site had problem(?) & wouldn't let me upload. Your loss! You wouldn't believe it.",

            "text": "I'm really happy with this machine. I leveled down to a non–self-propelled model because I was tired of the added weight and clunkiness. This mower is just what I was looking for, and it starts right up every time. The gas tank is a little smaller than I'm used to: I can mow nonstop for about an hour before a fill up. The deck is two inches smaller than my Toro, but I don't care--that enhances the lighter weight I need. I feel like this mower is definitely higher quality that the least expensive push mowers on the market. Very happy with quality and price. I like that it's made in the USA, even if some parts are sourced offshore.",

Consult the manual and learn that the oil must be drained through the oil filler. That means tilting and turning the machine which will cause any gasoline in the tank to also run out. To prevent that, the mower must be allowed to run out of gas before doing the oil change!The no throttle, no choke, \"Ready Start\" system works quite well right now, but will it be reliable in the years to come?  Time will tell.And I would not run the machine without fuel stabilizer added to my gasoline. Get it at any auto parts store and use it.",

I'm giving this machine 5 stars+ (1) I am not mechanically inclined. In fact, working on any project usually stresses me out for days. This DID NOT happen with my craftsman. I brought it home by 6:30pm and exactly 20 minutes later I was finalizing the lawnmower by adding the oil (provided in box) and gas. The instructions were simple and the step by step pictures illustrated nicely what went where and why! Thanks! Oh one note several reviews mentioned that their lawnmowers were noisy. (Make sure you add the prescribed amount of oil BEFORE starting your mower) Needless, to say, my lawnmower was very quiet and cut like a hot knife through butter. My yard looks Good! Lastly, how can you go wrong with such a quality name brand backing the product, craftsman and Briggs and Stratton. Also with the excellent price of $219.00 plus tax. I can't wait to cut my yard again (I have just under a 1/2 acre mostly flat yard) I hope this helps.",

After getting everything filled up, I went to get the pull cord into the holder, but couldnt even get it to unwind. The engine was completely locked up. After trying everything I could think of, including calling Lowes and reading reviews, I decided to look under the mower to see if there was anything in the way of the blades. The mower handles are shipped completely pushed thru the deck into the way of the blades. I have never seen or heard of a mower that has the handles go thru a hole in the deck. After pulling the handles out, of course it started right up. I am very interested to see if those holes will become a problem after several mowings. I havent seen any reviews complaining about the holes, so maybe the engineers figured out how to keep grass from escaping out of the deck...If anyone is having issues with the engine not turning over, check the underside before returning.",

I'm glad I did. The mower is quite light and easy to whip around. If you are debating getting a self propelled mower, consider the maximum slope of your yard and whether it will be a burden to push it up. If you have average strength, you will be fine with the push on a relatively flat lawn. The engine starts up very easily and has a self choking feature. Overall very impressed with this purchase.",

Luckily my husband is a handy guy and spent a few hours doing this. Although the metal coil popped out at one point and it took us ages to get it back in because it has to be wound tightly. It was extremely frustrating for me. Now that it is fixed, the thing functions perfectly. Although I gave up on the bag because it gets heavy quick while mowing.

The last one we purchased 12 years ago is still going strong so no need in the foreseeable future for us to have the chance to own one of these new models for ourselves. The leveling has become much easier with the tandem rise and lower system. Started first pull just like I expected. She loves it and I loved buying it for her!",

So I was thrilled to find a Craftsman push mower at Lowe's for a little over $200. I viewed it online, but went to the store to get it. They had plenty in stock.I'm a heavy-set 53-year-old grandmother with breathing problems. This lawn mower is easy to assemble and push. It runs like a dream and starts on the first pull every time. I picked it up, unboxed it, and put it together myself. I just followed the directions as well as two tips from other reviews: 1) pull the handle up all the way and secure it first thing, 2) add the oil before securing the pull-start rope.I've used it three times now and am very happy with it. My yard is about .25 acre and mostly flat. I highly recommend this cute little lawn mower to anyone who's looking for an affordable, well-built unit without all the bells and whistles of more expensive brands.",

I bought this mower as a fill in until I can get my rider back up and running. While it was not the absolute cheapest mower I could find it was cheap enough for a mower I will only occasionally use. There is, however, more plastic pieces on this mower then I have ever seen. They made every part they could out of plastic but I'm sure that's how the brought the price down. So far after a couple of uses it has held up fine. My only performance complaint is the side chute, it falls off with the slightest touch. It fell off when I pushed it through tall grass, or it I got to close to a tree and it rubbed up against it. I spent more time putting it back on then the lawn mower is worth.",

Being a single-mom with no help and a small vehicle for transport I had to be very picky on the new addition to my landscape equipment. I got all my questions answered and felt confident when I purchased this little red-hottie at my local Lowes. The awesome female associate there assured me I could assemble this Craftsman M110 without any special tools..She helped me load it into the trunk of my car as well. #Lowesemployeesrock! I got it home, unpacked the box, looked over the one sheet quick-start-set-up guide....Piece of cake...Unloosen two bolts and the T-bolts to pull the handle up. My only hiccup was, as another poster noted. You have to pull the handle up all the way to the first hole in the bottom notches so you can pull the string to start it. IF ITS NOT...YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO pull the string ....and you will get frustrated real fast....LOL.....Dont Give UP!! I was so happy when it started right away after that...it purred to life on the first pull....WooHoo!!! .....and I didn't get any blisters.....",

I went with this one due to price and the fact that I only need it for a couple months before I move to a place where I don't have to mow anymore and didn't want to spend a lot. I grabbed one in a factory sealed box, got it home, started to assemble it and noticed it was missing critical parts, such as the oil cap! So I returned it to the store and exchanged it for another one, also in a factory sealed box. I checked it at the store to make sure it had all the parts, it did, and took it home. I started to put it together when I noticed the handle / wire that does the engine shutoff (whatever it's called) was BROKEN! It shouldn't be this difficult to get one that can be put together and works right out of the box! With the amount of time and gas I've wasted with this, I should have just paid more for a better brand. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk.",
