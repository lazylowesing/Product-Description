Just make sure you bolt the base on correctly or they will be low in front. The drawing that comes with the instructions doesn't make it very clear which way to mount the base. I've included a picture of the right way to mount the base. Five minutes to assemble after you get it all out of the enormous box. I really wish the ottomans were available. Really pleased with our choice.",

I would recommend this set. it is just a tad more expensive than similar type products but I feel well worth it.",

            "text": "My local Lowe's had these on display and after sitting in them, I bought them on the spot - they are very comfortable and a good fit for shorter people.  I was also disappointed that the matching ottomans are no longer available, but the Carrinbridge ottomans are the same frame style (just plain dark brown instead of the faux woodgrain these chairs have) with a different color cushion.  I bought the Carrinbridge ottomans with the cilantro cushions (a little bit of a 60's vibe with the peacock blue chair cushions but not bad) and figure I'll get matching cushions down the line when these need replacement.  The wicker backs of these chairs set them apart from the Carrinbridge and Gatewood chairs, which are all metal.  The wicker is very nice looking for this price!  Thank you to the reviewers who noted it's easy to assemble them with the seat pitched forward - the store assembled the chairs for me and one was right and one was wrong and knowing the quirk in advance saved me some grief.",

We looked everywhere for someone to repair and had no luck. We contacted Lowe's customer service hoping to find the wicker so I could attempt to fix the places where it had begun to crack.  After a couple of days we were advised that they could not provide the wicker nor could they have them fixed and worst of that Allan Roth had discontinued that model.   But that if I still had the receipt and under warranty Lowe's would replace them.  We went to our Lowe's store with receipt and liked the Atworth Chairs, they are very well made, the chairs are aluminum and painted to look like a dark wood grain, the blue cushion are a very nice touch even if they are not sunbrella as the cushions on our previous set.  We took them home and put them together in less than 15 minutes.  We are extremely satisfied with Allan Roth products and Lowe's customer service and are seriously contemplating buying the complete set of their Atworth patio set and patio table and chairs.",
