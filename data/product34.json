But when it would read the news, video call (Duo) or answer questions it was really loud so it should play the book louder. Once I was in the car GP would not sync to the same point in the book I was at when listening at home on the GHH. Amazon Echo and Audible book would sync back and forth from my phone to or from the Echo View or Dot. Then I noticed that each time I would grab the display to reposition it the GHH would reboot, even in the middle of a Duo video call with my daughter. So I returned it and will wait for GHH 2.",

Cant figure out how to change split my screen as it showed on displayed with weather and traffic. Settings are through your phone instead of asking it. Talk about simplicity.

For example asking it to \"show me some recipes\" instead it gives me the definition of the word recipes. There wasn't a single word I asked to define recipe. Cant figure out how to change split my screen as it showed on displayed with weather and traffic. Settings are through your phone instead of asking it. Talk about simplicity. I asked to order pizza and it stayed on \"hello my name is Dominique would you like to place an order or check the status of your order\" I asked it to show me directions, shortly after a few seconds it gave me a frozen screen. For the price of this device id rather purchase google home without the screen and it has to be on sale. This item didn't work for me and returning it although I preferably think it belongs with a broken screen, in the garbage. Garbage!",
