The wicker is very fragile - either I broke one of the sticks on the first day or it was already like that when I bought it, and I just didn't notice. Just be careful with it.  However, it looks NICE!! The remote will change the candle to any primary color, which is very cool.  This is quite the conversation piece and would look good in almost any room.    I'd buy it again.",
