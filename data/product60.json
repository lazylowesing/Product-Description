But I did not mind.  In fact, it keeps things a bit more interesting, rather than just one boring color the way through.  One poster said their contractor had trouble cutting the tile.  Mine never broke a single tile, so not sure what their problem is.  And, yes, buy extra to allow for breakage.  Whining about breakage is silly.  You're dealing with porcelain tile -of course there's going to be breakage.  Especially when you are buying for a low price from a discount warehouse where they throw things on to the shelves.  Just get over it and buy extra.  You can return the broken ones.  It's a win.  No brainer.",

Installation went fine, I found the tiles were very uniform in size and color.  Our layout was a running bond with 1/8\" joints, in a 10' x 11' area.  The joints came out great with little variation or adjustment needed.Some other reviews mentioned signification variations in tile size and color.  I suspect that these persons did not use tiles that were all from the same lot.  Whenever getting tile be sure to check the numbers on the box labels and verify all the boxes are from the same lot, meaning they were all manufactured at the same time.  Tiles from differing lots can vary in both shading and even size, due to the manufacturing process.  Even though all our tiles were in the same lot, we still worked from multiple boxes at once when installing them to ensure any color variations that might exist would be spread throughout the floor.",

The colors between boxes match fine.  If I paid $5/tile and there were a few broken, then I'd be upset.  But, it's unfair to buy a very inexpensive product and complain about poor quality.",

Most tile stores are charging at least $5 per square ft for a porcelain tile that has a carrara marble look. I already spent a ton of money on my renovation and it felt nice to save money on this tile.

The main complaint is that the color completely changes when placed on a vertical surface, going from creamy white to dull brownish grey. The photo shows square tile in Futuro White that looks exactly the same as the tile on the wall, and the lighting is pretty equal for both spaces, so the difference is accurately dramatic. Also, the tile chips a lot when being cut. We thought we needed a new saw blade because the glaze and the porcelain were both chipping when cut. We thought it might be our moderately used diamond blade, bot we got the same results after placing another high-end diamond blade on the wet saw. If this IS porcelain tile, it appears to be a very substandard grade. But then, when you consider the low price for this tile, one could argue that we got what we paid for.",

Some were more grey in color with a more matte finish while others were more white with a bit more of a sheen. We ended up purchasing a LOT of extra tiles and spending a great deal of time sorting them to come up with enough that were the same size and color for the job. After a while, we realized that there is a number on the side of the tile. Some of them ended with 2 and some ended with -2. The tiles within each numbering group were more similar to one another. These tiles are sold individually. I recommend buying only whole sealed boxes of 18 tiles. (You can always return the extra.) The tiles within each box were of consistent size and color. So make sure you have enough of one kind to complete the project before you begin.",

Overall, this tile is durable, great looking, and well-priced.On another note, I do not believe some of the lower reviews are valid. Considering most complaints are due to lack on knowledge when installing. The review should be about the tile, not the contractor or logistical problems faced when purchasing the tile. If you know how to have the tile installed, you won't have any issues. Be sure to always purchase tile from the same dye lot.",

I read the reviews... if you have rough edges it was not installed properly. If installing on the floor... cuts should go under the wall base. If installing in a shower... all cuts should be in the two corners with the side walls covering the back wall cuts. It should be cut close to the existing back wall and the grout/chalk will cover any slight imperfections. It looks beautiful... also used a glass mosaic tile (12x12 sheet) cut into three four inch strips as an accent. Most of the negative reviews I read is due to installer error. ALL tile comes in dye lots... you must get the same for the entire job or there will be shade issues. When the tile is fired at the plant... different firings produce a slight color difference. That is why bullnose is always slightly lighter or slightly darker. It is not fired at the same time. I personally NEVER use bullnose because of this issue. In situations where a transition is needed I use marble thresholds or wood transition strips. If I am meeting another tile... I make sure to lay the job out so the finished factory edge meets the existing flooring or the cut edge will show and will be an eyesore. The negative reviews I am referring to is for the 9x12 in this style. One other note... in showers I use a 3/8 schluter metal matching the shower door or faucets.

In a number of cases I ended up with some larger gaps next to smaller gaps, and it's most noticeable where four corners meet. When you're trying to make something look pristine, it's near impossible when your tiles are not consistent in size. I bought my entire set from the same lot number, but there were still variations. Variations are mostly between different boxes, not within the same box. I did not notice any difference in color fortunately. Again, all were from the same lot number. I would double check the boxes, but count on the tiles being different sizes. Variations up to about an eighth of an inch are not uncommon. Makes it's near impossible to do a pristine looking job due to the variations in tile size. I don't think I would choose this tile again in the future or recommend to a friend.",

The color and the look of the tile match my vanity top, so I can't complain there. Given a redo, I might go with the larger tiles, as they are thicker and easier to cut.

We needed 42 boxes of this tile and had a lot of trouble getting enough quantity of the same dye lot from Lowes even though I ordered in store and was assured by the associate that they would make sure to get the same dye lot. The store experience was quite bad, but we were even more disappointed with the quality of the tile. The tile is rated PEI 4 in the specifications, which is what our contractor recommended we should get. But during installation, he saw how difficult it was to cut this tile and how brittle it was and said this was not a PEI 4. Four out of 42 boxes had broken tiles. In addition, the tile would break into shards when cut. When compared to another tile we had bought for another room, which was also rated PEI 4, this tile was nowhere as durable. The PEI rating for the other tile was printed on the box as well as on the tile, this tile had none of those. Additionally, if you check the PEI for the other sizes of this tile they are rated PEI 3, which is what I suspect this tile is as well. Unfortunately we were too far along in our installation to switch to a different tile, so we used what we purchased and returned the broken tiles. Luckily we had enough overage to complete the job. We are keeping our fingers crossed that this tile will hold up to normal traffic in the house considering how brittle it seems to be.",

            "text": "I  bought all my tile from the same lot at one time so I  did not have color matching problem. I had just done the breeze way with some slightly more expensive tile, just prior to using this stuff. The more expensive (slightly) tile I used first was easy to work with, one or two cracked on chipping, size was uniform, cut well with a dry tile saw. The Futuro tile was being dc'ed, price break, so I brought it. It seemed like it was lighter in weight. It chipped on the edges when cutting with the saw dry. Did find that using the saw in the wet mode and dipping the tile in warm water before cutting decreased chipping dramatically. Maybe a new blade would have helped. However it was still much harder to work with as it was brittle. Trying to cut the hole for plumbing was ok with pilot hole, but trying to extend with an angle grinder with a ceramic blade, resulted in breaking. I had made one cut of the pie, starting another and disaster. I had cut the more expensive tile the same way no problem. Jig saw with ceramic blade works but it takes several blades and takes much longer to do.",

            "text": "My husband and I are doing a complete renovation of our new home with 3 bathrooms. We ordered tile for 2 bathrooms from the Tile Shop, but decided to save money and get tile from Lowes for the 3rd. I bought multiple boxes of this tile, and brought home. Our tile guy later informed us that the tile shades varied - and we should go back to Lowes and make sure we purchase the same \"dye lot\" - so I went back to Lowes and made sure I purchased a new stock of tile (I'm returning the others) and got all the same \"dye lot\", so the color would be consistent. Be forewarned - the color varies from White, to Gray, to Taupe, and it's VERY OBVIOUS, so getting the right dye lot is super important! On top of that - the tiles are GARBAGE. They break / shatter very easily. My tile guy even noticed in the stock that we purchased, that was all the SAME DYE LOT, there was STILL COLOR VARIATION, not a slight color variation, not a hint of a different shade, but BRIGHT WHITE vs. DULL GRAY.....so even in the same dye lot, the color was not consistent at all. Who wants mismatched tile in their bathroom? Not me!!! Frustrated, but determined, we continued w/ this tile in our downstairs bath. We did our best to go through the boxes we purchased to watch for shade variation and put up the best matching tile. So now I have tile on the floor, and tile on the shower walls and half wall, now we just need the bullnose. Well, guess what? The bullnose I bought does not match! It's BRIGHT WHITE vs DULL GRAY tile again. So surely, I figured - here we go again, another trip to lowes to swap out tile. So I went back to Lowes to see if I can get the same \"dye lot\" for my bullnose. Well, guess what? The manufacturer does not make \"dye lots\" for the bull nose. The boxes have \"Batch #'s on them. I was told by Lowes Customer Service that I had to bring my already purchased 9 x 12 tile BACK TO THE STORE, and OPEN UP THE BOXES of BULLNOSE To FIND THE BEST MATCH. Do you know that I went to 6 LOWES STORES in 1 DAY AND NOT ONE \"Batch\" matches my DYE LOT?\n\nSo what am I supposed to do? Have mismatched tile in my bathroom? I don't understand how you can sell me 14 boxes of 9 x 12 tile, and not have a matching bullnose? If I knew that ahead of time, I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED IT. BUT NOW ITS ON MY WALL AND MY FLOOR,......so my choice is to have a mismatching bullnose & hate everything about my newly renovated bathroom, OR tear everything down and start all over with new tile and pay my tile guy more $$$$$$. Thanks a lot Lowes. Thanks for selling me junk. Thanks for selling a product that has no support from its manufacturer. Thanks for sending me to 6 stores on a wild goose chase for something that apparently doesn't exist. You wasted my time, my money and my sanity.",

When cleaning tile, first you need to make sure the surface is free of debris, so a good vacuum or sweep is best. Once the floor is free of dirt or other particles you can use warm water and a mild soap to clean the floor. A mop or rag that is nonabrasive is best to use. Make sure to change the water frequently to avoid leaving a cloudy film on the tile. If the soap doesn't work, you can use vinegar and water with a 1 to 2 ratio, so 1 cup vinegar with 2 cups warm water. For stubborn marks you can mix a little baking soda with warm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before wiping clean with a damp cloth. Lowes also sells grout and tile cleaners in their stores that can help with more challenging stains.",

If you need more than a pallet, have the store order directly from the manufacture, this will guarantee the lot/run numbers are all the same (but will take a few extra days to get). As for rectified tiles, these are tiles that have been cut to a certain size, while this will allow you to have a tighter grout joint, this weakens the edge of the tile and make it easier to chip.
