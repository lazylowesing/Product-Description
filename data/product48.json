            "text": "My husband and I are in the middle of a total farmhouse themed bathroom remodel. I was having a hard time finding a mirror that was neutral yet made a statement. I found this mirror at Lowes but wasn't sure if I wanted to spend that kind of money. We looked into what it would cost to frame our own mirror with a similar style and the prices panned out to be pretty equivalent. Luckily Lowes ran a 20% sale and I was able to snatch it up. The mirror is very sturdy REAL wood, which is a relief. It has mounting brackets both vertically and horizontally so you can hang the mirror to your preference. It's not super heavy either - my husband was able to hang it up himself. Overall, we are very pleased with this mirror and how it completes our bathroom.",
