After a few years Lois (my wife) decided they didn't have the right look (I liked them).  Anyway, she wanted a more modern look and finally decided on 2  Mazons as replacements. I finally relented and bought 2 of the units. Not that the old Harbor Breezes looked bad but the Mazons did give the 2 rooms a special touch. They were reasonably priced and went up without a problem. I love a happy wife. The only bad thing is I have 2 good (used) fans in a box. I'm thinking of Habitat for Humanity. My sister wants one but they are a matching pair and I hate to separate them. Wish I had a picture of those mounted. I'll take a few pictures. Don't min the mess; I'm doing the laundry.",

            "text": "What an amazingly beautiful fan! Clean lines, streamline, very modern look! The finish is impeccable, and with the multifunction remote and it's settings how can you go wrong? Well that does it for all the good things I have to say. Now to what's important… I purchased a house which was flipped in 2016, October. After seeing the before pictures of this house, all of the ceiling fans in the house were removed and they only replaced them with one and that was the master bedroom. They replaced it with this beautiful fan from Lowe's/Harbor Breeze. I enjoyed it for all of about a year when the fan stopped responding to the remote.  It was stuck on the second speed, and no light.  Easy enough must be the remote battery right? I get a new battery for the remote ... nothing changed. Not long after that something woke me out of my sleep, like a loud snap. I woke up looking around like what the heck was that? Then I realized that the fan was not spinning. It wasn't responding to the main switch on the wall now, except a little beep that comes on when you turn the switch on.  After calling Harbor Breeze customer support, owned by Lowe's, the only way this can be replaced is to take the entire fan into Lowe's with the receipt in exchange for a new one. Obviously I don't have the receipt, and I'm probably going to be out of luck. Lowe's too, since I wanted to match the other two bedrooms with the same fan.  I get it, I don't have the receipt, but this is not really acceptable for a fan that was installed in 2016 barely over two years ago. I now have a fan in my family room from Hunter, it's about 10 years old and this is the second house it's been in. And it's running like a charm. Lowes if you're listening… I'll be happy to try your fans one more time if you replace this one.  I'd like to give you a second chance.  I realize I don't actually have the receipts but you know this is your product, and I'm sure you don't want it just “hanging” around! I'll be sure to update this rating if you do good by me. Thank you so much and have a great day!",

I'm pretty sure it's not coming and even though the fan itself was the perfect look for our room  I wish at this point we would have gone with a more reliable company. The only thing they tell us when we call is sorry it's backordered. (we're never getting that light)  so...... if you're looking for a small quiet dark fan. get this one.... if you would like light in your room.... get another one.",

I prefer the flush mount for a room of normal height because it doesn't wobble, although fan blades should be balanced after installation anyway.  I like the convenient  remote control that allows adjusting the light level.  The light is not real bright, but adequate.  I've converted all my household lights to energy efficient LEDs, and prefer lights with integrated LED panels (like this one) instead of LED bulbs, which do not work well with many household light switches.  Overall it is a great fan/light combination, and I am highly satisfied with it.",

Attach main mounting bracket and the housing hangs from a hook to make connecting electric a piece of cake. If you've ever had to hold up a ceiling fan while trying to do this you know what i mean! Then it's just a matter of plugging in motor and lights. There's more than enough space to fit wiring into housing- once again, if you've ever had to jam wires into a housing and try to get it to fit you know what i mean. Fan does have a slight hum, but nothing real noticable. LED light is bright enough for a 14x12 room. For those claiming the light is not bright enough, adjust the dimmer on the remote. When it is turned all the way up it is very bright. Easiest fan i've ever installed, can be done by one person in about a 1/2hr.",

Very noticeable. Mounting bracket was checked and all screws are the right tightness. It's the fan motor. If you decide to buy you have a 50% chance or getting one that will hum. Unfortunately, we will be returning. The hum coupled with the added frustration of someone turning on the light with the opposite fan's remote while someone is sleeping cannot be remedied.

            "text": "I loved this fan when it was first installed in my kitchen \"working\" area. The look and size were perfect however the light was so dim even on highest setting. Even though it says = 60 watts I think the frosted cover causes loss of brightness. Regardless, it is rediculously dim.  I always had to have 3 other additional lights on to see well enough even directly underneath it. Unfortunately, the \"LED bulb\" actually sort of fell apart inside the fan and obviously no longer worked. It was very tedious trying to even get to the bulb fixture and when I did it the casing around the bulb was chipped. Have no idea how that randomly happened.  I only have had this fan for 2 years. Finding a new bulb is rediculous as well. Too bad because the style and size were perfect for my kitchen decor. Until it wasn't.",

They tell me it's going to cost something like $15, and then another $15 for shipping, so $30 total, so at that point I'm annoyed it's going to cost so much (1/4 of the total fan cost just because I need to replace one blade) but heck I need to get it fixed so I'm ready to pay the $30.  Then they say \"We don't have it in stock, you'll need to call back in 6-8 weeks and we should have it in stock and can sell to you.\"  Now I'm thinking, ok this has got to be the worst customer service I've ever heard of.  I double check that they're serious and there's no other way to get it, put it in my calendar to call in another 6 weeks, and wait.  6 weeks roll around, I call, and again I'm told \"We don't have them in stock, you missed it and will need to try calling more frequently since it's done on a first come first serve basis and we don't put your name on a list or anything like that.\"  So now I guess I'll call once a week hoping to miraculously call when they get a delivery in, so I have the privilege of paying $30 to be able to use my fan again.

Even where they are mounted to the wall, it's still a pain. We spent a great amount of money putting in new better quality light switches only to have them over ruled by a stupid fan remote. When I want a light, I want a light, not a remote. Not to mention an ugly remote at that. Yes, Lowes, we all may see the picture of the remote, but online it's not baby poo yellow, so your defense of this is getting old!There are 9 LED bulbs inside these lights, but my 5 gallon aquarium has brighter light than these do. Using the lights on these fans is like going outside on a dark, moonless, night and using only a flashlight. I have always used the overhead in my sewing room when I make my orders for the day, but now, I might as well work in the dark. The moonlight though closed curtains is more light that these provide.Our goal was to change out the whole house to a bulbless lifestyle. And we did wonderful...until we bought this style fan/light. If you will never use the light, go for it. The fans are modern looking and put out a lot of air without being noisy. If you're ever going to need the light...you know, when you change sheets, clean, work, or do anything...buy a different light! I want to remove and return. I understand that my husband doesn't want to take down the fans, but this is worthless. I can only hope that these will die as soon as other people's fans so I can get something better!",

The sound is a bit higher pitched, so the sound of the blades do not drown it out as well. I would say that a few of my other fans make about the same amount of noise just at a different pitch. I took the advice given to other owners and made sure the mounting bolts were fully secured and not allowing additional vibration. This did not remove the humming. The lights are slighy dim on the standard setting but can become very bright if you hold down the light button. That was very easy to figure out and adjust to my preference. I agree that the remote seems very poor quality and has an ugly color, but its just a remote. The fan itself overall seems to be high quality and  is able to move air efficiently. This will be a great addition ti my guest bedroom.",

            "text": "This is the worst fan I've ever experienced. We purchased our home with these installed and we've replaced all of them because the design and the hardware are terrible. To start, you can't replace the light bulbs for brighter bulbs. The bulbs that it comes with are special for the fan, and yes they are LED, but when turned on don't make the room any brighter than it was before and I wish that was an exaggeration. Every room in the house with these fans have needed extra lighting. We even looked at Lowe's and online for brighter options, and there are zero. Second, you can only control the fan and the light from the remote, so if you are wanting to turn the fan or the light on, there is no switch and you have to have the remote. Which, thirdly, is made worse by the fact that you cannot get batteries for the remotes anywhere. The batteries are a special size that are not common, so when your remotes die there is no way to turn the fan on and off, and you have to rely on the switch for the light. I can't find batteries for it anywhere. The fans are tacky and bulky, and so dim and difficult to use that I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Just buy a normal looking fan with normal switches and normal bulbs and save yourself the trouble.",

If you have the most recent Mazon fan that includes a oval shaped remote with only 3 speeds the LED light on the fan should not be turning on by itself. To trouble shoot that version fan, you can try to re-program the remote by following these three steps. Go to the room where the fan is installed and turn off the power going to the fan. (If you have the fan wired to an ON/OFF wall switch use the switch to turn the power off) If you have any other additional Mazon fans installed in your home make sure the power to all of them are turned OFF. Once the fan is turned Off with use of the wall switch use the wall switch and turn the fan back ON. Within 30 seconds of restoring the power to the fan you need to press the black learn button located inside the battery compartment. This will re-program the remote to the fan with efforts to eliminate any type of interference issue that could be causing the light to turn on by itself. If the light continues to turn on by itself call 1-800-643-0067 (Lowes customer service) and order a replacement hand held remote control. If you need more technical help call the manufactures customer care center at 1-866-473-4537 and they can walk you through the trouble shooting steps to insure your fan is working properly.",

If you need to change the dip switch in the remote control due to a potential interference issue, first turn off the power going to the fan. If you have more than one Mazon fan make sure all of them are turned off first. Then slide the dip switch to your choice of either up or down -- the factory setting is up. Then restore power going to the fan & within 30 seconds of turning the fan's power on, press and hold the “Learn” button inside the battery compartment for 1 second. Once the receiver has detected the set frequency, the light of the fan will blink twice. Replace the battery cover. To confirm the remote control and receiver have paired successfully press any of the fan speed control buttons on the remote control. There is no need to have more than one dip switch due to the fans design. Every time you use the learn button feature the fan automatically chooses a new electronic code to pair with that specific fan so that the remote control operates that fan correctly. There are literally thousands of codes, so that more than 2 Mazon fans can be installed in the same home and can be operated with the remotes independently from each other.

Troubleshooting Tip: If your remote control is not operating the fan properly, it could be due to the hand-held remote control has lost communication with the remote-control receiver. To fix this you need to follow the learning procedure found in the instruction manual. Before starting the learning process, make sure that power going to the fan is turned off by use of a wall mounted power switch, or circuit breaker. Once you restore power going to the fan you have 30 seconds to press and hold the “Learn” button on the remote control for 1 second. Once the remote-control receiver has detected the new set frequency, the light of the fan will blink twice. If you have multiple Mazon fans installed in your home make sure the power is also turned off on them prior to starting the learning process so they do not inadvertently get re-programmed to the new set frequency. If you need more technical help call the manufactures customer service center at 1-866-473-4537.",

If the remote is not working properly, it is likely that the hand held remote stopped communicating with the built in remote control receiver. To fix this issue follow the learning procedure as shown on page 11 in the products instruction manual. If you do not have a manual one can be downloaded from the product page on lowes.com. The steps are easy, start by going to the room where the fan is installed and hold the hand held remote. While in the room remove the battery cover from the back of the remote and turn the power to the fan OFF. Within 30 seconds of turning the fan's power on, press and hold the “Learn” button on the remote control for 1 second. Once the receiver has detected the set frequency, the light of the fan will blink twice. Replace the battery cover. To confirm the remote control and receiver have paired successfully press any of the fan speed control buttons on the remote control. If you need more technical help you can contact the manufactures customer service department by calling 1-866-473-4537.",
