            "text": "I received this latch as a replacement for the original, which was a polished chrome latch. Not being available... this was a very good alternative. The thing is, the latch knob is loose and was this way from the moment I unpacked it. Not enough to be non-functioning... but not right, either. The knob itself has a wiggle of about 5% to the left and 10% to the right without engaging the opening or closing of the latch. It's just a bit loose in its seat. Once you turn the knob past these points in either direction... it engages the latch opening mechanism. The original was tight... no such lapse. Because of this... I give it a 3-star rating.",
