Came home needing to use the bathroom, and to my aggravated disappointment, the toilet still cloged although the water had gone down. Tried plunging again and nothing. Now aggravated even more and still needing to use the bathroom i search toilet snake on lowes.com and saw this one was only 10$. Bingo. Went to lowes, used the bathroom, and got my snake. After some effort and some youtube vids because i didnt feel i was doing it right i got it going and fixed the toilet. No thanks to my apartment maintenance.",

Many of the \"professional\" models were 3 or 4 times the price of this one, and since I really only needed it for one job, I went with this model.  It worked exceptionally well, removing the clog on the first try (a clog that I am pretty sure was a diaper that my daughter had flushed).  I cleaned the \"business end\" of the auger off and sprayed with a little WD-40 to prevent rust, and fully expect it to be perfectly functional on the next time I need to unclog a toilet.  Definitely a great buy.",

For a week I bought and tried several drain openers and plunged and plunged and plunged have an accordion style plunger that has always unclogged our toilet But this time the clog was tight as a TIC and would not budge I though oh no ! I read the reviews I ordered online with free in store pick up and took within seconds my first try the clog was gone Wew ! My toilet is now flushing great !!!! This is a GREAT device and everyone who has a toilet needs one Some said the end of the auger was messy and difficult to clean b/c of debris (poo) I gently swished it around in the toilet bowl to loosen the poo then kinda propped the handle against the the shower wall spraying the entire device with disinfectant cleaner let it dry then had hubby spray with WD 40 so it doesn't rust ( thank you for this tip) will hang in storage building for future use",

This was my first time using such a tool.  On my first try, I kept cranking the handle and the wire would not go down very far.  I reread the instructions and it said to push down while cranking the handle.  The wire went down fast after doing it correctly and then it caught on something.  I had trouble pulling it out, but I was persistent.  A bunch of toilet paper and other things too gross to mention was caught in the \"cage\".  I was so happy and now my toilet flushes beautifully.  I am a 68 year old female and if I can do it, anyone can.  The only negative thing was I didn't pay attention and I scratched my toilet bowl.  Oh well, I can live with that.",

Having previously scratched a toilet with a snake, I was almost resigned to calling a plumber (who would charge me a fortune and leave a trail of dirty boot prints all over my house) when I stumbled on this toilet auger. I was doubtful it would fix my issue, but given the reviews I figured I would give it a try. It took just one try to clear whatever was stuck in there. The only problem I had was finding the auger at my local Lowes. The website said there were a bunch available, but there were none in the plumbing aisle. Luckily a very helpful associate found a box full of them on the top shelf. He said it was probably a new item that hadn't been put on the shelves yet. Thank you Lowes and Liquid Plumr!",

I was very skeptical that anything other than calling a plummer could work. I tried plunging & then the dish soap thing. Nope.  I really thought that I was going to get nowhere with this too. It took me a couple of tries and I thought for sure that 3ft  wasnt long enough, but I met resistance at about 2 feet 10 inches and cranked the snake and pushed with force and it sent the motherload down the slough.  It works if your clog is in the toilet.I give it 5 stars because it works!! I have never used a toilet snake. I am a 50 year old mom with a bad hand. Have patience & don't give up!

I tried plunging and hot water with dish soap.  I used a regular drain snake and it wouldn't go around the toilet drain bends.  I got out an old heavy duty closet auger I bought at a yard sale that I had never used before. It got all coiled up and bent in a few places. I think maybe it was too stiff because of the larger diameter wire or i wasn't using it properly.  I had work scheduled so I left for a few days while mom pooped in a bucket.  On my way back I picked up this light duty closet auger at Lowes.  I brought it in thinking it wouldn't work and that I'd be removing the toilet to clear the clog. I snaked it in twice and on the second removal I saw some remanants of toilet paper in the water. I flushed and it worked normally. I ran the auger through a few more times to be sure it was clear. I think the key for me was being slow and gentle when I got to the clog. Im guessing that if I had kept pushing and cranking when I felt the spiral tension growing that this one might have bent like the other one.  Some patience and backing off then gojng in again worked well.",
