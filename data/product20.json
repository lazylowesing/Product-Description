The only hard part was no one was there to help me flip the table, I had to be careful not to scratch the table top while flip it alone.  So if it is easy for me as a lazy man, it should be super easy for you guys out there as the handyman.",

It fits well on the deck with some existing chairs we have and we have used it a lot. The benefit is that when expanding, the base does NOT move and the table expands through a railing system to reveal the 'hidden' section. Anyway, it's a cool table and I hope it lasts 4-5 years. I will most likely bring it inside during the coldest but that's only a couple of months out of the year.",

My first concern was that it would get very hot being metal and black, but it just gets warm to the touch.  The second concern is that it will rust.  We had a ton of rain recently and when I moved the table afterwards there was a puddle of rusty water beneath it.  So this concern may be valid given that it has only been in the elements for a couple of weeks.  It also scratches very easily so need to use placemats etc to protect.",

We live in Arizona where it's not practical to have wooden tables/chairs as they split from the dryness/heat of the air and would require too much Care.   We found this metal version and are thrilled with how great it looks on our Deck.   Very simple assembly of legs (only) and we were all set to enjoy it within 10 mins..  Definitely recommend the quality, construction, and practicality of function and design!   And certainly can't beat it for the price ($168)!!",

It even comes with a wrench but I used a 13 mm socket to make it go faster as I was short on time before needing to actually use the table.The table itself is sturdy and has adjustable plastic levelers on the bottom of the legs so you can make it level as needed. This is going to make an awesome addition to my furniture. I do recommend finding a table cloth to use as any messes (such as drinks that get bumped) will not be contained going through the slats, haha.

The downside is that this table is higher than most others to compensate for the on-board leaf. We have to buy new chairs as our existing chairs are not high enough. The black powder finish does chip and scratch fairly easily and might gave been more durable with a faux wood grain finish. We will cover with a table cloth or placemats to protect the top. All in all, a good choice if one needs the option for expansion.",
