This is an admixture for grout meaning you use this product instead of water or in some cases with small amounts of water depending on the manufacturers instructions while you mix the grout. This is all done BEFORE the grout is put into the grout lines. This product will help defend against stains, discoloration and will make your grout slightly denser vice just using water. If you are a DIY'er and you are tiling a shower this is a crucial part for tiled showers. Even if you are paying for the job, ensure your contractor is using admixture and will seal (using a different different product) the tile and grout lines after they are finished. Sanded grout is recommended for showers and epoxy grout is preferred. Again, if your grout is already between your tiles. This is not the product you need.",

You do not mention which grout you used so I will give you all options. If you used Ultracolor Plus FA grout then we recommend Heavy-Duty Stone, Tile & Grout Cleaner to remove the haze. Please note, Mapei does not recommend using the Mapei Grout Maximizer with our Ultracolor Plus FA grout. Use full strength Do not dilute with water Let cleaner dwell on surface for a minimum of 5 minutes and up to 10 minutes Scrub with a white nylon scrub brush ( with firm pressure) Wipe, mop, vacuum up any grout residue and water residue after scrubbing Rinse well with clean, cool water, keep your rinsing water clean to avoid spreading residue on the floor If you used one of our standard Portland cement grouts, Keracolor Sanded or Unsanded, then you want to use Cement Grout Haze Remover All this being said, When it comes to cement grout, there are quite a few reasons why the grout could dry to a different color. Sometimes it is application related (too much water in the mix, too many passes with the cleanup sponge), and sometimes it can be jobsite related (minerals in the water, temperature/humidity causing curing problems). In the meantime, there is a simple test that can be done with a small amount of your leftover product to rule in or out some of the possible causes of color troubles. Mix up a small batch of grout at a 4:1 (powder-water) ratio if it was sanded grout, and a 3:1 (powder-water) ratio if it was unsanded, in a disposable cup to a creamy peanut butter consistency. Let the cup of grout dry overnight and check the color the next day. If the grout is the intended color the next day, then something went wrong during application. If it is still too light, then the mixing water may be to blame (high mineral content) or it could be a product issue. We would love the opportunity to help troubleshoot with you and try to determine what may have led to your grout drying lighter than expected.

Grout additives function to increase water and stain resistance, however, sealers are topical and penetrate into the pores of the grout greatly enhancing their water and stain resistance.
