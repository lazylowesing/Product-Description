After all, if there's a will, there's a way. If I were to complain about anything, it would be the rubber weather seal at the base of the lock. This is the only design flaw in its outer appearance. If it gets caught or pulled at the corner, it will separate from the body of the lock. This said, it does not appear to affect the overall effectiveness of the lock. I would still recommend its purchase to anyone.",

I had the folks in hardware call master lock to see about ordering me another set, and that was a dead end too. as far as the locks themselves go the are very stout solidly built locks. I have no doubt that these will not be hacked picked or pried easily at all. all together a good purchase for anyone who is serious about security, so long as no more then four keyed alike are required.",
