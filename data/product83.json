            "text": "I want to love this cabinet so much more than I do.  Pros:  I did a ton of research on rolling tool cabinets before I bought this one.  First I identified my needs of storing all my hand tools along with an 8-piece lithium ion tool set.  This cabinet checked all my boxes with the perfect combination of thin drawers for hand tools and taller drawers for power tools and wood working clamps etc.  The power supply strip in the ultra-deep drawer is AWESOME!  Add to it the peg-board sidewall for accessory attachments in the deep drawer and on the sides of the cabinet and you couldn't ask for more customization for any of your home project needs.  I love the two drill holsters that come with this cabinet.  They stay in the drawer when not in use but I mount them to the side during projects for quick access to my drills.  The accessory shelf is also a nice touch but I wish it was larger (it should be at least the width of the deep drawer).  WHY DON'T ALL TOOL CHESTS COME WITH THE PEG-BOARD SIDING!?!?  That seems to be the major difference between this black 2000 series cabinet and the red one... yet it costs a $100 more???  Cons:  This is a big one.  THE CASTERS SUCK!  Specifically, the swivel casters.  The wheels are too wide and the tolerances too loose to allow consistent alignment when trying to turn the cabinet.  Inevitably one of the swivel casters turns one way and the other turns the opposite way or worse, gets stuck perpendicular to the other caster which causes the cabinet to seize up when rolling.  For the cost of this cabinet (and any cabinet for that matter.  I've never understood why these things cost so much) the casters should be butter.  These casters are CHEAP.  Since purchasing this cabinet I have checked out many other brands on the store floor to see if this problem is universal for all cabinets.  IT'S NOT.  Husky, Kobalt, Kirkland, Stack-On all swivel smoothly.  I have contacted Craftsman to see if they can make the caster issue right.  I have confidence they will and if they do I will update this review.  Until then, 3 stars because really, what good is a rolling tool cabinet if you can't even roll it around your garage without having to turn the swivel casters with your hand??",

Once assembled I began to push the cabinet and to my surprise the casters would not allow for movement. I literally had to Drag the cabinet. The casters on this cabinet are terrible. The steer casters do not swivel but will turn just enough to prevent proper movement. As my plans were to use this cabinet in my shop, portability is critical. Needless to say I have not loaded the cabinet with tools as a stationary cabinet is useless to me. So I cannot comment on the cabinet itself or functionality of the drawers other than to say it is impressive in its appearance. I would not recommend this product.",
