Everything that you cook on this grill turns out with grill marks and tons of flavor. I'm so happy I spent several hundred dollars more for this four burner masterpiece.  There is tons of cooking space to cook for 20 people.  I will be a lifelong Weber fan.  The best part about this grill is, it makes you look like you are a serious Grillmaster!!  Thanks Weber!!",

I don't like the side shelves not having a insert tray to protect the stainless steel. Plastic end caps on the shelves are cheap looking. The doors open too far and can become scratched when opened all the way- should have stops. The scale mechanism for the tank isn't very accurate and can get scratched by the propane tank. Grill looks great and easily heats up to 510 degrees F. Left side wheels are too small and makes it tough to push on a wood deck. Side burner has been very useful and heats up quickly.",

Also, Hot plate type burner on the right side.\nThe only thing it needs, is a place for my iGrill.\nI found a place where a plastic plate had an iGrill Decal.
