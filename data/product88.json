            "text": "This is a basic mounting bracket meant for cross-arm mounting.  Each of two metal supports is fastened with one wood screw to the cross-arm.  This is done twice, providing support for the rear and the front of the mailbox being mounted.  There are four fastening nut/bolt combinations which are the used to fasten the mailbox to the metal supports.  The metal supports are pre-drilled with multiple holes to enable different width mailboxes and the overall arrangement seems very sturdy.  I gave only 4 stars because I would have liked another pre-drilled hole to accommodate a slightly wider mailbox (like the one I mounted); also, it would be nice if there were lock washers for the nut/bolt combinations.  Overall, a solid product.",
