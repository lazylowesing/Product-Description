            "text": "I bought this chair to replace one that I bought at a big office supply store for about $80. This one is more than twice the price but mostly worth it. This is much heavier than my previous and I think will last longer and withstand more abuse. The specifications state that it is rated for 350 pounds which seems to be plausable, I would have guessed more. I like the cover material. The padding is ample. Another vender carries this same chair with the title \"big man's chair\". The cardboard shipping box had label \"big and tall chair\".. (this does not appear in the Lowes title). The actual size does not really go along with that description. The seat depth (front to back) is a couple inches shorter than my last one which is a bit short for me (I am tall) but I have gotten used to it.. Back is nice and tall. Seat is acutually a bit narrower compared to my other two office chairs. Pleanty wide for me and for 95+% of people but I would guess a really wide bodied person (e.g. 300+ pounds) might find it too narrow. I ran into a problem during assembly, the two \"short screws\" supplied to attach the front of the seat plate to the seat cushion were too short. .There was a set of spare screws in the package with which I made do with one medium and one long screw. I sent an email to Office Star Parts on Thursday night requesting a medium scfrew. I received a package of screws Monday with enough screws of various sizes, including the one requested, to probably assemble two more chairs with some left over, so I can't really complain about that. My guess is there is some manufacturing variability which resulted in the screw problem.",

            "text": "This is just an initial review, but my impression of the product is that it is made of quality materials. It was quite easy to assemble. My husband & I put it together in about 25 minutes. The directions are clear, and they give you a packet of 1 extra of each of the screws just in case you need a spare. It is very comfortable to sit in. I spend many hours doing computer work at my desk (and do take frequent breaks), but I was experiencing nerve pain in my shoulder with my old chair. So far, I have not had the shoulder pain with this chair, most likely because of the better back support & much better cushioning. I will return in a few months to give an update to report on wearability. The warranty on this model is excellent! As of this writing, beware of the Hercules Big & Tall 24/7 chairs--the warranty on those only covers them for \"normal use\" (a 250 lb person using it 40 hrs/week!). Not so with this chair.",
