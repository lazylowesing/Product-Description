(Please note bits of grout had fallen onto the surface of the sink and were there for 10-20 minutes which is normal when grouting.) I tried all the recommended remedies, soft scrub, vinegar, dial soap, nothing removed the stains. I called Franke customer service and was told that they will not pay for a new sink to be installed because they are not responsible for issues from \"regular use\". Yes, \"Regular Use\" was a quote from the manager, so don't plan on using this sink regularly unless you want it to look like mine! A sink should not stain when grouting. They do not stand behind their product and they do not take customer service seriously. I will NEVER buy another Franke product and I would highly discourage anyone else from purchasing one as well.",

I was using regular dish soap as advised by the manufacturer, Soft Scrub, baking soda, you name it.  It just didn't look good.  I finally used Scrubbing Bubbles foam one day and it took the sink back to looking like new.  I've had no scratching, no stains, it's held up and looks like the day I purchased it.  We have very hard water here so I occasionally will use vinegar around the faucet and drain to remove the minerals.  If you have a problem with oil/grease spots or streaks, I recommend using Scrubbing Bubbles since it was the only thing that worked for me.  I'd purchase this sink again.",

The reasons I went with 4 stars is the first sink I brought home was cracked in three big pieces, so I had to rush back to the store when the countertop guys came to install it. And if you use a paper towel or like product to wipe the sink, pieces of paper can get stuck to the grain of the sink—no biggie, I can use other products just fine. But worth mentioning.",

The granite company had no issues as noted- however it did require a mount bracket for our application. The sink size and depth is great for hand washing large bowls and pans. We have hard water in this area and the sink does show a milky haze and or water spots at times. We rub a thin film of Crisco shortening or olive oil on the sink with a paper towel about once a week and it keeps the spots at bay.  I was also told there is a  product that can be applied that lasts about 4 Months. It is reportedly for use on granite and stone. It is a bit pricey 30$ per quart but reported to be worth it. The product is Aqua Mix  stone enhancer. It is sold at a local tile shop. I plan on picking it up for next usage. A friend who has the same sink uses it about two or three times a year and claims it is better and lasts longer than the oil method.",

A Lowe's representative told me they could not assist me and that I would have to contact the manufacturer.  I contacted Franke, KS-Customer Service and provided all necessary paper work and the claim was denied citing that I was negligent in dropping or throwing something in the sink.  I asked them to provide anything that would support that claim.  I can afford to purchase another; however, considering how much money I have spent over the years with Lowe's I don't believe that it is wise to sever me as a customer.
