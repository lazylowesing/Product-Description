            "text": "I expected this thing would be a flop; to die a quarter or even half-way in, but surprisingly I was able to mow my entire backyard (approximately 6400 square feet) and I still had half of the battery left. What's even better is that it'll last me for the side-yard and front yard as well. This is accurate with the manufacturer estimate I read somewhere which states it'll do about a quarter of an acre on a single charge. Now, keep in mind that I walk quickly. As I would get into thicker areas of grass, the mower would speed up to compensate. So the battery life will be dependent on how think your grass is, how fast you walk, and the depth you set it to.\n\nThe box it comes in has holes on the sides so it's easy to carry. The mower only required minimal assembly (attaching the handles), so it was easy to get right to it. I did not need a single tool to assemble this or get it going. Now, the battery came 25% charged and took over an hour to reach a full charge, so I would estimate an hour and a half from fully dead to 100% ready, though the site states 2.5. \n\nThe handle is ergonomic and designed at just the right angle to take the stress off your wrists. It feels like you're riding a riding a speed bike. I have a bad knee and a messed up back, so having something which is about twice as light AND has an integrated lift handle at its fulcrum point is a deal-breaker for me. It's about as easy to push as a gas mower with a self-propel option (except you're not having to waste more gas on the extra belt/gear/motor/chain to drive it). \n\nThere is a cover to prevent water from getting into the electrical compartments, and the bottom is sealed well, in case you decide to get crazy with it and use it in wet environments. There is a key which must be inserted to run the unit (just in case someone wanted to steal it). You can take this key, drill a hole in the top, and put it on your key-chain/carabiner or elsewhere for an added security measure. Of course, someone might be able to buy one of these and still use it. \n\nI'm not sure why there is a kill switch running along the wire towards the power button, but it's there in case you need it. It does take a few seconds to stop the unit however. If you let the throttle rod go, it'll die within a few seconds just like a gas lawn mower. However, with a gas mower you can catch the rod right before it dies and that will give it enough fuel to start up again, but with this mower you can't do that. -It's either all or nothing. However, you get the benefit of simply pushing a button instead of having to yank a cord each time. Speaking of cords, there are none! I used to use a corded mower and while it was still lightweight, it was a NIGHTMARE constantly having to lasso the cord from place to place like a cowboy. \n\nI like to leave my grass cut high, so I set the unit at its highest setting (7), and it matched the height perfectly at which I would normally keep it. This also means that the mower didn't have to work as hard since it didn't have to go as deep. It also reduces the amount of clippings, though normally I would just mulch it anyways. In this case, the blade comes very sharp from the factory and mulches up your clippings very efficiently. I like the side discharge option, which you can switch out back and forth to a bag if you will by removing the rear insert. The clipping bag is designed well. Whereas a typical bag would be long and short, this one is short, tall, and reinforced, having extra metal bars around the opening and even a handle stitched into the back to aid with disposal. -Did I mention this mower has a single lever height adjustment system? -That's right; all wheels adjust with a single lever. Perhaps for professionals there is some use to an independent system, but for the average Joe this is top-notch. \n\nLast of all, I love the fact that this mower is emissions free, reducing exposure to more harmful chemicals. I know after a long mowing session I can feel nauseated by all the toxins, especially if I have to quickly jog through and get the lawn done before the sun goes down. I'm sure there are a few things I'm forgetting (like how quiet it is), but with a 5 year warranty on the unit and 3 years on the battery, this is GREAT! You'll be able to mow late at night or early in the morning, not having to bother your neighbors or family while they're sleeping.",

            "text": "This Kobalt mower has the 3 in 1 options that everyone loves and uses. It can mulch, use a side discharge or use a bag, which is included. Also included in the purchase is a 3 year warrantied 40 V battery, and a 6 Ah battery charger. The mower, itself, has a 5 year warranty. It took my husband 15 minutes to assemble without any tools required. The deck measures 20 inches and the mower weighs 56 pounds. It can store vertically in the garage and offers a brushless motor.\n\nThe wheels are plastic and the rear wheels measure 10 inches. The very nice feature of this mower is the ability to change the cutting height to so many different levels ranging from 1 3/8 inches to 3 3/4 inches. The battery and charger provided works also with the other Kobalt 40 V max system tools. The battery has a nice fuel gauge which shows charging level. The mower blade is 20 inches and is made of steel.\n\nThe mower has an electric push button start, which operates very quickly and quietly. It started the very first time without any effort. The handle also can adjust to three different angle operating positions. My husband is 6' 4\" so he has the handle at the highest level.\n\nThis is not a self-propelled mower, but it operates very easily and cuts very efficiently.",

But for a smaller yard, it is great. \n\nIn the pictures you will see the before cutting and after cutting. The 2 inch wide tires are prefect to keep from getting deep tire marks in the grass as you can see and we had rain the day before so the ground is soft. You can also see the clippings in the bag showing a nice clean cut. My only true concern is the plastic knobs that hold the top half of the handle in place. They are plastic and as such, if over tighten may well strip out. \n\nWhen you first get this, the battery has to be charged and this will take a couple of hours to do. \n\nTime will tell how good the battery life is. For mowing our yard which takes about 20 minutes, found the battery still had ¾ charge left. Grass type mowed is Fescue. \n\nHere is what I like;\nBag fits between the handle making for easy removal and installing.\nCatcher is easy to empty.\nWide tires.\nEasy one hand height adjustment. There are several heights to pick from.\nHandle height adjustment is easy to do as is folding the handle down for storage.\nBattery is easy to take out and reinstall. This goes for the safety switch too. There is also a place to store the switch.\nCharger can be hung. \n\nCon: \nPlastic knobs for top half of handle. \nGrass catcher size. Could be a bit larger.",

            "text": "I was looking for a low cost gas powered mower when I ran across these electric / battery push mower. I was skeptical at first but read reviews from others and decided to give it a try. Glad I did! No more gas, oil, oil filters, etc and its MUCH quieter.  I was impressed by the power! and I was impressed by how the motor revs up/down based on the how thick the grass is.  Would I buy one of these again? Absolutely!  Would I upgrade to the 80v? I don't know, probably not.  I debated between the two and the 80v was $100 more but came with two batteries.  Here's my assessment of the 40 vs 80v: if you need 80v system you probably need a riding lawn more. And here's why: I can almost mow my entire yard with 1 battery charge and I almost need a riding lawn mower (see pics).  The 40v lasts about as long I can last in the hot Florida Summer sun. I just cut 75% the lawn with one charge and when the battery died, I was glad! Needed break. And if I don't need the break, I just grab the battery trimmer and use it while the mower battery is charging.  I could spend $80 for a 2nd battery but decided to cool off and do other tasks while the battery is charging. The one downside is that the battery get real hot and it will not charge when hot. So I have to put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to cool off before charging. One important point: I do not use the self-propelled feature as it drains the battery faster and I need the exercise! :)  If you need a self-propelled system, you might consider the 80v system due to the increased demand on the battery.  I've attached pics to show you how much I just cut with one battery charge.",

The 5.0 amp battery that comes with the mower works great and when mower hits higher grass, the rpms of the mower increase.  This does not happen with the 2.5 amp battery.  The 5 amp battery has an average runtime but you can't buy a replacement that is 5.0 amps.  While it is nice for a very small lawn, your average lawn will likely need a 2nd battery.  Poor execution from those designing and deciding replacement parts to carry.  I wouldn't buy again unless it came with two 5.0 amp batteries.",

            "text": "Was needing to replace my gas-powered push mower this year.  It was wearing out.  My wife needed to be able to mow some too, when I was away at work, but she has shoulder problems and would struggle to pull-start a traditional gas-powered mower.  We have a smallish area that needs mowing with a push mower; We use a riding mower on our larger area.I looked at many gas-powered mowers because they certainly were nice, and I wondered if my wife could somehow pull-start them. I knew I couldn't/wouldn't afford an electric start mower.  Then I happened across these battery powered mowers.  I had not considered them because I thought they weren't any good.  The battery powered tools I'd had in the past were greatly inferior, and I didn't need an inferior mower that lacked power, didn't cut well, didn't last, and whose battery dies.  Little did I know.I read the specs and reviews.  These battery-powered mowers seemed like just what I needed for a small area - push start-ability, light and easy to maneuver, good cutting, sufficient battery, with the added bonus of no gas or oil.  And the reviews were mostly favorable.  So after thinking about it objectively, I did a little more research and decided on this model to meet my needs...a good mower for small areas that my wife could use, and at the right price.I charged it overnight and assembled it without difficulty.  My wife and I tried it out and we liked it.  It's easy to use, it cuts good, and the battery easily lasts for our purpose.  I cut for about 10-15 minutes, then I let it sit for 45 minutes while I prepared the next area, and then I cut that for another 15 minutes.  The battery still had two lights indicating 45% charge left.  It cut good too, better than I expected, and as good as I needed.  It might not have cut as good as a high dollar, high powered gas mower, but the grass I was cutting wasn't perfect either.  And just like you typically need to go over the same spot sometimes anyway even with gas mowers, I did re-trace my cutting occasionally mainly because the grass/weeds were bad.  But I wasn't displeased at all.  I was pleased it did the job I needed, and it did it very well, I thought.  And the battery held-up too.  I also liked the automatic increase in power feature when it was needed, and the easy height adjustment for my wife.  Now, if my wife wants to mow when I'm away, she can mow without any trouble at all.  No fuss, no muss.  Good decision, good product (for us).  I recommend.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't know how durable the machine will be over the long term.",

Now I do not have a huge grass area to cut so that is why I decided to make the switch from gas to electric. If you are thinking of making the switch I would say go ahead and do it, you will not regret it. I can get 2-3 mows of my lawn on one battery charge, which will run for ~40 minutes on a full charge.",

            "text": "I was a bit hesitant to go with a battery-powered lawn mower based on some of the reviews, but decided to give it a shot. I've now mowed my lawn about 8 times with it, and have been pleasantly surprised. For reference, my lot is about .20 acres...my front and back yard combined take me about 16 minutes to cut (I timed it). The mower does a great job cutting. The blades kick into a higher gear when needed (taller or wet grass), and slow back down as needed. It's incredibly quiet, just a pleasant \"whirrr\" sound is all you hear. The battery life lasts longer than I expected. I'm able to easily cut my lawn twice on a single charge. Can almost get a third cut on a single charge, but comes up just a bit short. I believe this matches up pretty well with the advertised rate of 40 min per charge. Love that the mower folds and stands up on its end, makes storing it against a wall a lot easier so it takes up less space. I also have a Kobalt battery powered leaf blower which accepts the same battery, which is great in that I have two batteries that are interchangeable. I think my only complaint would be that it's not recommended that you spray it off with a hose...would love to be able to hose this down afterwards to keep it clean, but it's recommended you just wipe with a rag. But overall, extremely happy with this mower, and happy to never have to run to the gas station again before cutting my grass!",

I have a 1/4 acre lot, so after subtracting the space for my house and driveway this mower should be perfect. It took 2 charges just to mow my backyard. And it had only been a week since it was mowed previously and it was not overgrown. I waited another week and tried the mower again. It still took 2 charges for the backyard and 2 for the front. I decided to return the mower. The woman at Lowe's told me the battery is only designed to last up to 30 minutes and I needed to run with it if I expected to mow 1/4 acre with it. She also said mowing in the heat will cause the battery to overheat and die quicker.",

            "text": "I was a bit hesitant to go with a battery-powered lawn mower based on some of the reviews, but decided to give it a shot. I've now mowed my lawn about 8 times with it, and have been pleasantly surprised. For reference, my lot is about .20 acres...my front and back yard combined take me about 16 minutes to cut (I timed it). The mower does a great job cutting. The blades kick into a higher gear when needed (taller or wet grass), and slow back down as needed. It's incredibly quiet, just a pleasant \"whirrr\" sound is all you hear. The battery life lasts longer than I expected. I'm able to easily cut my lawn twice on a single charge. Can almost get a third cut on a single charge, but comes up just a bit short. I believe this matches up pretty well with the advertised rate of 40 min per charge. Love that the mower folds and stands up on its end, makes storing it against a wall a lot easier so it takes up less space. I also have a Kobalt battery powered leaf blower which accepts the same battery, which is great in that I have two batteries that are interchangeable. I think my only complaint would be that it's not recommended that you spray it off with a hose...would love to be able to hose this down afterwards to keep it clean, but it's recommended you just wipe with a rag. But overall, extremely happy with this mower, and happy to never have to run to the gas station again before cutting my grass!",

You would think that would be great saving battery and all but if you're just mowing light grass sometimes it doesn't get all the grass at the slow speed. most of the time I have to go back over all my grass twice.

It literally takes 10 minutes (tops) to get the handle assembled and, besides charging the battery, that is all you need to do to run this. Sadly, I have to return it because my 1+ acre yard is just too big for this model. I had to recharge the battery twice and I still wasn't even half finished with my yard.

I love that when I am finished cutting my grass that I do not smell of gasoline (from mower exhaust and filling). It is also nice that the mower self-adjusts the speed of the blade to both cut cleanly and maximize battery life. The mower is lighter and easier to maneuver. My yard is pretty small so the battery life is no problem. Although I think this mower would do most normal sized yards and if you have a larger yard than just buy an extra battery.

I even got an extra battery, since my yard is around 0.3 acresHowever, the runtime doesn't come close to what they claim. Not even half. It takes 2 full batteries to mow just the front of my home, and about 3 to do the back yard. So, I basically have to mow every day of the week while charging the batteries overnight. It is a nightmare. I don't understand why the batteries are only 5 Ah. That is not enough at all.I can tell you this: this experience has convince me to never buy an electric car so long as I live.",

I cut about 2 tenths of an acre and go through 3- 2.5 amp/hr batteries and one 5 amp/hr in the same day and often still can't finish the yard if I wait longer than a week to cut it. The side shoot is too small and the mower chokes out frequently from too much grass around the blades. I modified the ejection port to make it bigger and cut the grass on the second level to compromise.. works better but still chokes out very frequently. I cut the grass backwards to throw clippings outward instead of towards my next line, still doesn't work. If you cut your grass at LEAST once a week it might work. It worked decent in the beginning of the year but now that grass is thick I'm ready to throw it away.",

I don't know if I'm trying to take things too fast or what, but it does get irritating.

            "text": "Lowes has another winner with the new second generation 40 volt Kobalt mower.  The new brushless motor brings the quality of performance up to the same level as the 80 volt Kobalt which also has a brushless motor.  It's so easy to use; press the button, pull the lever and you are running.  Anyone can do it!  The unit is light and the power is uncompromised for a mower of this size.  It's ideal for lawns that are around 5000 square feet and you can easily mow your lawn and do most of your trimming and blowing w/ the 5ah battery that comes with it.  It trumps the E-Go mower that Home Depot sells with it's steel deck and for the money it simply can't be beat.  The other really cool thing is that the battery that comes with the mower, will also run the other 5 40 volt Kobalt tools that Lowes sells.  The string trimmer, blower, hedge trimmer, chain saw and pole saw all run on the same battery!  It's like taking the gas tank off one tool and running the others with it.  I've learned that once you have a couple tools w/ batteries, you can go to Lowes.com and order the others without the battery for a considerable savings.  For example, the bare mower is $70 less than the one that comes w/ the battery and charger!Unlike Home Depot, Lowes outdoor tool selection is complete in that I can buy every single tool I need to do all my lawn care work and run it on a single battery platform.  Home Depot carries more variety but it requires purchasing multiple batteries and that's the most expensive part of the cordless equation.  I highly recommend the 40 volt mower, especially now that the motor is brushless.  (By the way, the warranty is 5 years on the mower; 3 years on the battery.)  That's the best warranty out there!  Buy it and love it!",

The mower does not cut my yards grass well at all.  Regardless of the number of times I mow over the same spot it seems to leave uncut grass.  When I mow the spot once it cuts about 95% of the grass, and upon a 2nd pass it cuts about 98% of the grass.  I have checked the rotation of the blade, as well as if the blade is sharp and all check out.  I have taken the mower back to my local Lowes store and they have offered no help to my problem, as my lawn mower technically is working.

Tired to repeat all the steps above and nothing. I called customer service and their only suggestion was to do what I already did then they said to return in lol. Now I have to try to take it apart, put it back in the box, and drive back to Lowe's. This was my first experience with an electric mower, not a great start :-(",

I have about a 45 min to an hour worth of cut time and his never died on me and mine is great. It charges quickly and has a battery indicator on it. One of my favorite things about this mower is it senses when it is going through a thicker patch and the motor ramps up to get through it. If you have super thick grass and want to cut it really short than maybe this mower isn't for you, but for a standard lawn it works great!",

Here's the problem; it comes with a 5 amp battery, but Lowe's only sells a 2.5 amp if you want to get an extra.  I'm thinking of the fall when you sometimes cut your grass over and over until you get to the lowest level so you can aerate and seed.  One battery won't cut it.  These should come with two 5 amp batteries.  If you can't get at least one hour on a charge, you should comp a backup battery.  Otherwise, great and when I flipped it over to clean it...no oil or gas to spill all over the place",

If you need to deal with high/thick grass, then raise the deck and work your way down.  Just like you would for any *other* push mower.  I've had no issues with battery life.  Indeed, if you keep up with mowing regularly, you won't necessarily find that the battery lasts *longer*, but you might find yourself getting more area taken care of in a shorter period of time.The only significant complaint is the lack of readily purchasable adequate replacements for the battery that comes with it.  I'd be nice to be able to do so where I purchased it.",

Then when I try to charge the battery it overheats in the charger and I have to pull it off. Last time it took about four hours before I could get two bars of charge to finish the lawn. Though tonight it cut the whole yard no problem. First time I used it I got two passes on a charge, see #2 for why I needed two.2. It misses a lot of grass blades. No particular pattern, all different parts of the path (center and sides). Maybe a little better when the motor is spinning fastest. So many missed blades it almost takes two passes, see point 1. I'll start with sharpening the blade, though it looks great.I really like the low maintenance and lack of gas in the garage, but may go back to Dino fuel if these battery and cutting issues cannot be resolved.",

It was surprising light to push and much quieter than gas motor. Front and back yards together are less than 1/4 acre and flat. I was able to mow front and back with battery power to spare. The mower added power in thicker grass when needed. One handle easily adjusts all 4 wheels at the same time, which is a great innovation. Specs indicate 2.5 hours for a full charge which was faster than other makes. But my first charge after it was completely depleted was less. I was able to take the battery out of the mower and pop it into the Kobalt 40w trimmer to get more work out of the trimmer, which has a smaller capacity battery. Looking forward to using it again and adding more 40w tools.",

The grass is thick St. Augustine in FL about 5” tall. Used the bagging option and mower set to the 4 (middle) height, will use 5 the next time. It is fairly light but sturdy. The grass looks great.

If you are looking for a light duty mower, for a small to medium sized yard and hate refueling your loud mower with gas, this is for you.  When you insert a full battery into this and start it up it's a different ball game altogether, I get people asking me all the time why its so quiet not to mention how light it is.  But that's where all the good go, that aside, like I said it's not useful for medium to large yards at all, save your money, time and energy, don't stress yourself out because this is a battery drainer. I bought an extra battery ($125+) from the Kobalt because with only one, I could only finish half my backyard in about an inch and a half grass. It stalls if you go too fast, the side discharge gets clogged up and don't even try mulching cause it won't work.  Altogether in the attached picture took me \"4\" batteries (2 battery, recharged full charge the next day). And you can't recharge them right away because it's too hot so you'll have to do this overnight. I would say, don't let this new technology, the quietness and sleek design sway you away from the more powerful gas alternative.",

Have not had mower in well over 10 years and with a small yard got the 40V mower & it will mow the yard, if I don't use mulch.  Why fertilize when I can mulch.  When I use mulch I can't mow both front & back yard so it takes two days to mow my yard.  So not happy with the 40V mower.  The best thing that happened to me was the battery to die in a little under two years as the mower was bought in 16.  Called Kobalt they said go to Lowe's & get a new battery well Lowe's does not have any 5A batteries just the 2.5A batteries in stock.  Lowe's could not have been nicer they called Kobalt & said it would take at least 3 weeks to get another battery or could trade it in for a new mower.  I ask if I paid the different between a 40V & the 80V, could I upgrade, they said yes.  So I now the 80V mower & the difference is night & day.  First it has 2 batteries but I can mow both front & back on only 1 battery.  By the time I got the new mower my grass was a little high the 80V just kicked up a little faster & kept going & done the entire yard in mulch mode on only 1 battery!  The 40V would bog down in high grass & in mulch just eat up the battery.  The 40V was ok with out mulch but with mulch it was very week.  Very happy that I now have the 80V,  Like I said the 40V was just a little weak would not buy again.  A little like getting out of a Ford Ranger into a Diesel Super Duty.",

It's quiet and starts instantly and makes mowing our lawn something I almost look foreword too! A few things - lot size, 1/5 acre no problem, any bigger and you will be needing a second battery or taking a break between front and back to charge. Also, it works awesome if you keep on top of mowing. If you have really tall grass (2 weeks growing..) you can't just plow through at a low deck height - it just does not have the power. I do a knock down pass at max height, then a second pass at 2-3 and it's fine. Also it gets bogged down a bit with wet grass. Overall once you learn how to work around it's limitations in raw power it's fantastic.",

So I was happy to review this product when I had an opportunity too. I have an average size yard my lot is 60 by 110 my house sits in the middle and isn't very large. When I first set the unit up I noticed right off that it was very light, but not in a bad way, it was light but sturdy, you could tell it was quality material. I Read through the owner's manual and charged the battery which only took a few hours. I was able to cut all of my lawn still having one bar left on the battery, It took some getting used to, because it's battery operated it has a startup process which is relatively easy but then the motor and Battery cycle probably to cool it off, but it still cuts grass while while it's going through this cycle. I would say that before you purchase this item make sure that it's the right fit for your yard, if you have a big yard I would look at this unit as a 2 cut process with a battery charge in the middle like I said only takes a few hours to charge it. It all depends on what you're looking to accomplish and your time frame. If you get home from work late and cut your grass after work this would be a great unit it's quiet and would not disturb anybody so with that said, it did a great job on my lawn.",

I live in Florida and we are having very mild weather and un-seasonal warmth which we are already starting to mow. I have found that the (one) battery (and to purchase a spare is not an option and not available) that comes with the mower will take up to \"3\" charges just to get through my front yard now. It also takes several hours to re-charge and this is embarrassing. This was entirely a waste of money and I would never expect to find a product like this at Lowes.

I was also tired of buying new cords when the old ones got cut by the old mower.  I toyed around with getting the 80-Volt mower but decided not to because I have two 40-volt batteries for my string trimmer and hedge clipper. I was not sure if the cordless mower had the power to cut high grass.  I should not have worried.  It is a real beast.The battery for the 40-volt mower is 5 An “extended run” version versus 2 Ah “Quick Charge” versions that came with my older string trimmer and hedge clipper.  The 5 Ah battery is heavier, but both size batteries fit in the mower and the chargers.  The 5 Ah battery lasts longer, but with three batteries, I can cut 3/4 acre of lawn without stooping.  For example, I just \"dethatched\" my lawn with the height setting at 1.  I was very impressed with the power of this mower and how well the bag picked up all of the clippings.  I especially like how the mower automatically shifts into high speed when the grass gets thick.  I did not expect that and love it.  It literally never bogs down.  This feature shortens the battery life, to be sure, but I've never run into grass that is too high for this cordless mower . . . and that's cool.",

In my opinion either way between cutting,swapping batteries and charging fast or not it's either going to take hours or days depending on if you have the time.

I cross-cut the leaves back and forth in several directions to get them finely mulched, so it would actually be fine for a larger size lot if you're going over it just once. Have had no problems at all with the battery - I read in several places to let it cool down completely before sticking back in the recharger and maybe that's the magic trick. I'm 60 so the light weight of the mower is perfect, it's quite easy to push (I also don't let the leaves get too thick between sessions, cutting about once a week for 5 big old oaks)and the 40v battery that comes with the mower lasts as long as I do for getting a good mulch of the space in one session. I don't use the bag attachment, too small for a big area without making a lot of stops to empty it, I just cut with the side-hatch open and get a fine enough cut that the leaf-bits either blow away or replenish the soil. Storage is easy and not having to deal with a gas engine is wonderful. Very happy with this purchase, for my purposes this is a perfect little machine!",

Great if you have young ones who want to play with things they shouldn't.

            "text": "I bought this mower in the Spring of 2017 along with a 40V Kobalt chainsaw that uses the same batteries. I absolutely LOVED it the first year! Plenty of power and battery life - it was perfect for my small yard. I did have some battery issues, though. Batteries would suddenly be unable to be charged, with the charger showing a bad cell indication. If left on the charger long enough (weeks or months) the pack would resurrect itself. Go figure... Since I had two packs it wasn't that big of a problem for me.The trouble came the next spring (2018) and trying to find a replacement blade. In short, THERE ISN\"T ANY. After going to several Lowes stores and chatting with Lowes.com it became obvious that they simply don't carry a replacement blade (though they didn't actually admit it). I ended up buying a blade sharpening kit and got the original blade sharp enough to cut reasonably. Note: This is difficult due to the curvy design of the lightweight blade. Note also that should you bend the blade it is likey to render the mower useless. Remember: no blades are available. I plan to eek out the remainder of the season with this mower but replace it with aother electric next spring (2019). I will NOT replace it with a Kobalt! Hopefully the big name toomakers stand behind their products better than I found here!",

The folding feature is nice where storage is a problem. Very easy to maneuver. I use only where my riding mower won't go. The 40 amp battery is a 5 AH. I have a Kobalt weed eater and the batteries will exchange. A big plus for me. I do not know how long the battery will last but it is more than sufficient for my use.

When we first got the mower, the battery would last for the entire yard cutting. We have had this mower a little more than a month and are incredibly disappointed in the battery life, as now it will only cut about a third of the yard before it dies on us and we have to wait to get it charged back up again. We also purchased the battery operated weed eater also, and have had nothing but issues with its battery not wanting to last. We chose this mower because we didn't feel like we wanted to waste time with gas, and also it was a lightweight mower for me to operate as I am six months pregnant. If the batteries weren't such an issue, I would have given it a solid four stars.",

My lawn isn't that large (whole property is 1/4 acre including the house) and I need 3 batteries to mow the whole thing.  My mower came with one battery and the other two batteries are from the 40V Kobalt 13\" trimmer and leaf blower that I also bought.One of the problems that needs to be addressed is that the batteries get warm and deactivate themselves.  So, you do not always get the full run time from each battery until it cools down---and this takes a long time.  We have had mild weather this spring and I wonder how bad the battery heating problem will be in the summer when ambient temperatures will be much higher.Then end result is that it typically takes me just over 1 hour to mow and trim my yard---usually 50 minutes of mowing and 10 minutes of trimming and blowing.  Sometimes this takes longer and I need to wait for the first battery to charge a bit.  Maybe someone will come up with some off-brand batteries that work better.",

My yard has a pretty extreme slope in the back and on the side, but the light weight makes it easy to handle.

            "text": "I really wanted a cordless. Wanted to be more green. Did not want to deal with gas. And Lawn was too big for a corded mower. Did research and Kobalt seemed like the way to go. I have a decent yard, but it is not huge. About 4000 sq feet. According to sign the 40V Kobalt was good for 1/3 acre, which is way more than my yard. Got it home and charged the battery. First thing, not as advertised. Read it would take 30 minutes for a full charge, I am finding it takes 2-3 times as long for me. Still 60-90 minutes was ok. Started mowing on a cool day, mid 50s. Mower was quiet, light, easy to push, and did a nice job mowing. I could hear the engine rev up a little on the thicker parts of the grass (as advertised), and was happy it was doing a good job. Then after going through a little thicker area, it shut down. This is 1/3 of the way of just the smaller front yard. Tried to start again, and it would give two beeps and shut down. Took battery in and put it in charger, and a red light came up on charger, indicating battery was too hot?!. After maybe 15 minutes on a cool day? Figured it was a defective battery. Used a different battery that came with the Kobalt weed wacker and was able to finish both yards and was happy with the job. Wanted to get a new battery, but Lowes said to bring the whole mower back. Did that and got a brand new mower. Again mowing on a day in mid 60s. Grass was a little high in sections, but not over grown. Made it to the backyard this time, and it did the same thing.  Returned the mower and got a gas one. So. I WAS happy with the mower when it was working. Maybe I got unlucky and got two defective batteries. But did not want to take a chance of having this happen all the time, when the summer heat kicks in.",

Then I went to Home Depot and looked at their Ryobi and was told by THEIR employee to go to Lower and purchase the Kobalt. I get to one lowes, they're out of stock and tell me I should buy an AWD Husquervana gas. Thankfully I didn't because it has 2 stars on their own website. Go to another lowes and at this point I've convinced myself I need to buy a gas mower. As I request the Troy Bilt, the employee plugs my ear with \"HAVE YOU SEEN THE KOBALT?\" So, I gave in and said why not... and this review is exactly WHY NOT. Ran the mower twice. Pros: Starts easily, looks fancy, quiet, light, easy assembly. Cons: everything about mowing the yard. Battery on run 1 lasted a total of 17 minutes. Charge time was approximately 4.5 hours to a full charge. Run 2 with a full battery was a total of 11 minutes!! I would need to have 4-5 batteries at that rate to mow my yard which is a quarter acre!! Absolutely inconvenient, and as I type my backyard has a MOHAWK to stare at. Have fun citing me on that, HOA. The good thing though, full exchange or return no questions asked aside from \"what went wrong?\" and I chose to bite my tongue and just utter back \"the thing is crap.\" Bought myself a Troy-Bilt gas mower with a Honda engine for the same price aside from fuel and oil, etc. All in all, I can't wait to be environmentally unfriendly again.",

Light weight, so I don't feel \"beat up\" after a mow as I did with a gas powered unit.  There is plenty of power to cut through long grass, although this negatively impacts battery life.  Works best when maintaining grass height.  Took a bit of getting used to swapping batteries (2.5 from the trimmer & 5.0 from mower), but on a normal trim, can get the yard done on the two.  If it's long and/or wet, trimmer for starters on the 2.5, recharge it while cutting with the 5.0, then finish off with the recharged 2.5, no down time waiting.Very quiet, so no neighbor issues mowing early in the morning.",

No more shopping for gas, oil, and filters.  This electric mower purchase has me turning all my gas powered equipment in for kobalt electric 40 volt.  I was skeptical about 40volt versus 80volt but the price and now my experience has me satisfied with the 40volt power and reliability.

It's so quiet. My neighbor was giving me an odd look from about 40 ft away so I asked him what's up and he said he was wondering what I was doing because he didn't hear the lawn mower at all but he was seeing the grass get shorter and shorter. Keep in mind I'm 27, a female and weigh 115 this lawn mower doesn't need to be self propel I was pushing it with one hand at some point. Its so lightweight and the fact that I can store it vertical is even better. The price is more than worth it. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. NOW I TOO SWEAR BY KOBALT. Heck I'm even wanting to open a grass cutting business. I love not having to smell the fumes anymore or have to deal with the constant cranking. I was able to cut a few feet short of 2 acres before the battery finally died.

            "text": "After spending a couple of hours trying to get my old gas mover to start, I took the plunge and bought a new Kobalt 40-volt cordless mower.  Spring is here and my grass is only getting longer.  I read many of the reviews, both good and bad, so I was optimistic, but also apprehensive, that it could do the job on my lawn.  I have about 8,000 square feet of lawn, some of it on a steep slope, with many turns and tight places.  In the Pacific Northwest where I live, April to June means a lot of mowing and the grass can be thick and wet.  The Kobalt 40-volt was easy to assemble.  It took two hours for the battery to charge.  Because my grass was tall, and it had rained the day before, I set it up as side discharge.  It had no problem mowing for more than an hour and around 6,000 square feet of lawn, or 3/4 of my yard, on one charge.  Less than 10% of the time did it kick into high power mode.  It's lighter than my old gas mower, easy to maneuver, cuts smoothly and is nice and quiet.  No ear protection required. So far I'm very happy with the Kobalt 40-volt.  No pull start.  Light.  Quiet.  No oil or gas.  It remains to be seen how it will hold up over time, and I'm a little concerned that the 5.0 amp hour replacement battery is currently unavailable,  but based on my first use, I give it 5 stars.  I will submit a follow up review in November after a season of use.",

Easy to put together , all you need to do is attach the handle , put on the grass disperser and decide if you want to bag or mulch. I put the battery in the charger right away and it flashed green for about two hours and I pulled it and plugged it into the mower. There i is a yellow key near the battery, someone else said you have to remove the key to run it. No, that's backwards, you leave the key in to the run it. I would say I have an average sized yard and it cut my grass no problem with the one battery. I did have some issues with the check battery status button on th battery , it only worked after I was done and I had one bar left. This mower is plenty powerful to cut thick grass, 6-8 inches high. It does not bog down , but increases power as needed . It's pretty cool it Revs up and down when needed and you don't need to hesitate when cutting. Chomps right trough !! 5 stars to the Lowe's employee that helped me at the new mount pleasant, sc store. He actually helped me with two things!!",

I thought it over and since I already have a 40 Volt trimmer and the reviews here were mostly favorable I decide to give it a try. Kobalt already has a reputation for quality products so I knew the chances were slim I would be disappointed. The mower comes pretty much already assembled. I only had to assemble the handle and then charge the battery. The first thing I noticed was how quiet this is compared to a gas powered mower. While cutting I noticed that the torque on the mower would increase in thicker grass. It can sense how thick the grass is and adjusts accordingly. My yard is not very big so this was perfect. I used the mulching feature and the mower did a FANTASTIC job. I would highly recommend if you have a small yard and are tired of the gas and oil purchases.",

The problem is the power supply (batteries) the five amh battery last about 30 minutes the first year of ownership then deteriorated from there. I bought a second battery which was a 2 amh battery that cost $100.00. Two years later both batteries will not fully charge (two power bars out of four) and frequently ends with a red light on the charger. Can't afford the power source and with out a reliable power source the mower is useless. I have gone back to a reliable gas mower which uses less than a quart of gas to mow a half acre lot which calculates to $18.00 in gas a season. It will take 5 to 6 years of mowing with gas to equal just one 2 amh battery. I would highly not recommend this mower, I had to replace it with a reliable gas mower.",

I expected this as run times are always exaggerated on manufacturer claims. That's ok because 20 minutes in the hot sun at a time is about all I want to do anyway, so built in breaks. Recharging takes a few hours and currently you can't find any extra 5ah batteries to purchase anywhere. It would be nice to have a spare battery,but like I said, this works fine for my needs. If you try to mow wet grass, expect about 10 minutes run time (because it's working hatder) and stopping frequently to unclog the chute. Those critiques aside, not dealing with gas, oil and air filters more than makes up for the shortcomings and if you really need more run time, spend a bit more and get the 80v mower. It's also really easy to store vertically and clean in this pisition. Just pull out the battery and safety key and scoop out the stuck grass before putting away. Lowes, you really need to get more of these batteries in stock. I'm probably going to want to buy a spare next season.",

First off the standing up vertical was a nice touch, but really the biggest change I appreciated was the knobs/screws to fold the handle over was much better design.  Overall for the money I'd recommend this mower for small yards, anything bigger go for 80V.",

The battery lasts about an hour and the charge is fairly quick. So far, it has been a good choice. No oil, gas, plug, of exhaust. Less fuss, same cut",

It kept shutting off every few minutes. I assumed it maybe just needed to charge fully the first time. Tried next day showed fully charged but did the same thing. Called Kobalt support very helpful stated it was probably battery and they could send another one 5-7 days or I could take back to lowes and replace whole thing. Did that and charged fully and works so far so good. It cuts pretty good, does get bogged down a little in thicker stuff but to be expected. I have a typical subdivision house and yard and can get through 75% of front and back if normal height. I wish the battery lasted a little longer, but still pleased and with back problems it's a godsend. It's so light, no pulling to start, and magic!!",

When one battery depleated the second one took over.  I was able to cut my whole yard with this system.  When I got this mower it came with a 5amp battery with a single brushless motor.  I thought with the upgraded motor and larger battery I would be able to cut the same amount of lawn.  Wrong.  Battery runs out of juice about 15 minutes before I am done.  Luckily I have another battery so I can complete the job.  This mower should have come with an additional battery to increase run time.  The mower is good but this is my major disappointment.

It was clear that the mower blade speed is not fast enough to cut in one pass in some instances.  The main thing I did not like is how plastic it is.  Some may see this as a benefit as to durability, no rust, lightness etc.  I then bought the Kobalt 40V brushless, push mower.  I love it.  In comparison it is way more sturdy, has more weight and that makes a difference in not bouncing around on the ground as you push it.  The cut quality was better than the Ryobi.  Clearly cutting the grass in comparison to the Ryobi.So far just a few days, but I like it.  I opted for the 40V versus the 80v for price, and the fact my lawn is not that large.  I did consider the EGO but would instead go to 80V if I go up to more power at this time.  Next year I suspect we'll see a 100V model by some maker.  For our lawn size 40V seems right.Battery mowers like this will have limitations.  Don't bad mouth the product simply because you cannot mow a larger lot or it does not pick up leaves.  For small yards this is a great mower.",

All the great reviews about it said it could now about a quarter of an acre with no problem. This is not even slightly true. Or may be true if you barely have anything to mow. If the mower has anything thick to cut through or your grass is slightly even damp, you will have to restart about 50 times due to clogging and then your battery will run out due to overheating. This mower is not a great purchase.",

However, anything much over a half hour you will be running the risk of the battery dying. 40 minutes max if you're lucky. You also need to be someone that keeps up good with the mowing. It's not that this mower won't power through tall wet grass because it will. The problem is the toll it takes on the battery. Can cut the battery life in half! This may also cause the battery to overheat which can take up to an hour to cool down enough to charge! The battery can then take over 3 hours to charge! Starting and stopping a bunch can also cut down some on battery life. So if you have a small well maintained yard then you will absolutely love this mower. Quiet and lightweight like many have mentioned. No need for self propelled for most.",

With it still being inside the 5-year warranty, they were happy to refund the original purchase price since it wasn't made anymore, and replace with this one.  Since 80V is a thing now, the 40V is quite a bit cheaper than the original, and at first I wasn't thrilled about not having the 2 battery slots.  However, I'm pleasantly surprised by the increased run capacity with the brushless motor.  I still miss the better mulching of the twin-blade design, but this thing hogs through thick grass almost as well as any gas motor.  Once the lawn was back to normal length, regular mowing is just as easy before, with easy start up and nearly zero maintenance.  Definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble starting a gas motor or just wants something that is very easy to keep running and a heck of a lot lighter than an engine.",

I have just under 1/4 acre yard and it takes three charges to get through it (mowed 4 times so far). I've tried everything imaginable to get the battery to last longer, (following advice given on other complaints regarding battery life) but it's apparently just the inadequacy of these batteries. The cut is consistent and clean, when you have battery life...just don't expect to cut very long before you have stop for 5 hours to recharge the battery. If this is the future of “clean” yard products, it leaves a lot to be desired. I think I'm just really disappointed. I had such hopes for this quiet machine. I'm now left wondering if I should go buy a 2nd battery to get through my tiny yard, or if I should just cut my losses and buy another gas-powered machine. Are there any suggestions I could try to prolong the battery life? I want to like this mower, but with the 30 to 45-minute battery life, it's not meeting my needs. I bought this based on the cut times provided by the company and reviewers on the website and on the box. I simply have been unable to come close to the times advertised on the website.

            "text": "I was hesitant to enter the cordless lawn mower market because of the myriad of products offered and the crazy way batteries are rated and reviewed.  I did some research and decided that the no gas, oil and engine maintenance is where I wanted to be.  I have a lawn under 1000 sq. ft. in the front and about 2500 sq. ft. in the back.  So far only the front is needing mowed.  There is no grade, bumps or hills in the lawn.  The mower has worked perfectly with all of the attachments and the battery has been fantastic.  Blade is sharp and provides a clean even cut.  I mowed the front lawn twice and put the battery back in the charger and it was still almost fully charged.  Much quieter than other mowers and you can store it upright because there is no loss of gas or oil.  Craftmanship is excellent and the price point was right in line.    Quite happy with this purchase.  My better half thinks the blue looks cool and that's why I let her mow the lawn now.",

The batteries that came with our mower worked fine for a few seasons (from 2015 to 2018) but this year, within months of each other, we had three dead batteries (one was from our Kobalt trimmer). Kobalt will not replace the batteries since they are no longer under warranty--which is understandable. What isn't understandable is that to replace all three batteries would cost nearly $300. I could buy a brand new gas mower for that! Spending $300 to replace batteries every few years is ridiculous and to that end, they are also difficult to find. In my store, they only carried a 2.5ah battery (cost me $80) and it took three charges and several hours to cut my lawn. I would never recommend purchasing one of these mowers!",

No fuel, no cords , just easy mowing. You can stop and start it multiple times to move items for example without having to pull a cord to restart. It really is light enough to push up hills with ease. The charging lights on the charger are easy to understand and the battery has a built in guage. This guage is my favorite, taking out the guess work of how much a battery is charged. It has a nice bagger also. The one level height adjustment is neat for matching various mowing conditions. Mowing time is as reported and can be longer if you take breaks. Nifty and care free mowing-almost. It can be tempting to forget that you are using a mower since this is so quiet. The same safety practices should be used with this one and gas mowers regarding foot placement and projectile protection.",

            "text": "We needed a new mower and noticed the prices on the battery-powered ones now match that of gas powered (used to be $500~800). We were going to get another Kobalt that was the same price on sale with two batteries, but saw that one has a 4 Ah and a 2 Ah. This one has one 5 Ah battery. I was able to mow ~20,000 sf with still enough charge left over. Pros:Lightweight. No need for a self-propelled feature on this. It's light and easy to push, which I really like, since most self-propelled mowers are hideously slow. Plenty of power. I'm able to do the whole lawn on one charge. It takes about 2.5 hours to fully charge, which isn't a problem. Hopefully the battery capacity doesn't degrade over time. Large wheels. The 8\" rear wheel and larger front makes traversing uneven terrain easier. Vertical storage. It stands up on its own and can be stored away easily. Not having to store gas and oil is also a huge plus.Quiet. It seems to have a low and high speed that automatically adjusts, starting slow after starting, then going fast after a while. Either speed is like a big fan. Cons:No major cons so far, but my only complaint is the smooth plastic housing which easily attracts dust and gets dirty very quickly. This shouldn't be a problem in the summer months cutting wetter grass. I just wipe it down with a damp cloth and store it, though. Battery-powered appliances have advanced quite a bit recently. If you are on the fence as whether to go gas or electric, give this one a try. With the long warranty, it should last a long time. If the battery starts to go out after five years, a new one is about $150, which is probably about what you would spend on gas, oil, spark plugs and filters on a gas mower in that time.",

I already own 2 of the Kobalt 40v tools and have 2 2.0ah batteries so that basically made my decision for me. The battery life seems to be the only major issue with this type of mower. Well let me tell you I was very impressed! Got it home today assembled (maybe 10 min) put the 5ah battery on the charger which says about 2.5 hours on initial charge but I could not wait to try it so what the heck popped in my fully charged (3yr old) 40v 2.0ah battery and fired it up. I started mowing and did almost my whole yard (6500 sq ft mow area) before the 2.0ah battery quit on me so I popped in my 2.0ah battery from my 40v weed trimmer (3yr old) and finished the rest of my yard and had enough battery to finish trimming and blowing off drive way and still didnt stop. So I will have plenty of battery life performance with the new 5.0ah batteryI am sure! So if you already have any 40v tools and have battery life concerns its really a no brainer to me. It was light weight and easy to push. Easy 1 height adjustment for all 4 wheels. So in closing I did about 6500 sq ft with 2 2.0ah batteries and have extra to clean up and trim. I do recommend this product!",

I'd known for several years that we were a good candidate, as our small (1/4-acre) lot is probably 50% beds, so not a lot of grass. Also, we don't anguish over having perfect turf, so I didn't predict that electric-mower's well-described tendency to be a bit, uhm, uneven, was going to be a problem. We bought an open-box model yesterday and couldn't be more pleased. Really sort of set it up to fail: grass was tall and wet from rain earlier in the day, when we'd started the job with our gas model. Honestly, you couldn't tell the difference (and we keep the gas mower in good shape, ie, regular replacement or sharpening of the blade). Because it was open box, and the end of the season, we got a steep discount. But honestly, it would have been worth it at full price. Plus, I'd already bought a Kobalt trimmer this year, which I love, and they use the same battery. It's so great to get away from gas, as our yard is modest in size and these tools are quite up to the job.",

When I first bought it in 2016, the battery life was good and it had good cutting power.  But it stopped turning on after a year and they sent me a replacement, which was supposed to also fix a problem where the motor could start smoking.2 years later, this summer, my replacement lawnmower starts spewing smoke out of the bottom, so clearly the fix for the motor did not work, or they sent me the wrong replacement.  The product has a 5 year warranty and it's 3 years old, so I've called the support number twice about a replacement.  Both times the support person gave me some evasive answers that \"the vendor would call me back\", and I haven't heard from the vendor yet.Hopefully Kobalt can fix some of these things because the product shows promise.

Last year I bought the 40volt blower and was please with the power and battery life. so then came the hedge trimmer and then the string trimmer. The ease of just slapping in a battery and your good to go, cannot be overstated.  Lawn Mower: I have an 1/2 acre lot and it takes about 1 1/4 batteries. Light weight but also light weight construction. No issues so far. I wouldn't recommended it for heavy brush but does a great job on an established lawn. Battery: Love these Lithium batteries. 10 years ago, I had the whole collection of B&D's outdoor tools with NiCad batteries. Those batteries became unusable after one season(running time dropped fast and took forever to charge). I can fully charge these Lithium batteries in about an hour(may take longer after heavy use and if the battery gets hot). I can fully charge the Li batteries, come back in a week and still find a full charge(NiCad- fully charge, come back next day, 75% charge).",

            "text": "I purchased this mower to replace a walk-assist mower that was difficult for me to handle. I had seen this mower on display at Lowes and liked that it seemed to be well built and light in weight. I also liked the fact that it was a cordless, electric mower. After about 3 weeks of mowing every three to four days, I feel this mower is definitely worth the money spent for it. It has performed very well. It takes me about 30 - 40 minutes to mow my lawn and the battery has been lasting the whole time. I usually have 1/4 showing on the gauge when I get done. I have only used it in the mulch mode and it mulches the grass into a fine mulch. I am extremely happy with the mulch. The mower handles very well and pushes easily. The height adjustment control is easy to use and the mower is very quiet while using.Overall I am very glad I purchased this mower and would recommend it to anyone wanting to use a push mower, good exercise. If the battery lasts for 3 years and the mower for 5 as advertised, I will be very satisfied. I would purchase another one of these when the time comes to replace it.",

It's light and easy to maneuver around obstacles, fence posts, etc.  The negative reviews about charge time are not fair to the design goals of this unit. Read the box and manual:  it is intended for smaller yards--ones that can be mowed in 35-40 minutes or so. My lawn takes approximately 30 minutes to mow and I had two bars remaining.  This is my first foray into electric mowers and I'm happy with where I landed with the 40V Kobalt. I mulch only, and so far--the results are as good as any gas mower I've used--only better due to the instant start and reduced upkeep. By the way--this is a light machine and I do not miss the self-driving feature of the more expensive models.  Highly recommended for smaller lawns.  I am considering the 80V for my father's large lawn which I also maintain. Highly recommended!",

I thought that I would not have to go to the store to get gas but in turn I spend more time waiting for the batteries to charge because the charge doesn't even last long enough to do my front yard!It would have been LESS time consuming and less frustrating to have to pick up gas while gassing up my truck at the same time than waiting for these stupid batteries to charge just the do my front yard, and then I still have to do my backyard! It's RIDICULOUS! I will never recommend this brand or this company ever again. This is after only one week, from Saturday to the next Saturday. The grass doesn't even get that tall but it's too much for this lawn mower to handle, it runs it out of battery power in 20 minutes, if I'm lucky... Realistically if I wanted to mow my front yard AND my backyard I would need to 3 or 4 batteries! Except the batteries are VERY expensive... In the attached picture you can barely even tell the difference between the grass I cut and the grass that I haven't cut. I was just trying to make it even and flat! ** I been trying for 30 minutes to attach a picture less than 5MB but it will not load no matter how many times I try to upload a 3mb picture. Yay, even this website is terrible!** I wish I could turn this thing back in for a full refund.

            "text": "I bought the Kobalt 40-volt Brushless Lithium Ion 20-in Cordless Electric Lawn Mower on 05/14/2018 for $299. It came equipped with a 5-amp battery and charger. I bought it on a Monday night after my old gas-powered mower finally bit the dust halfway through mowing my front lawn. The following day, I was actually excited to get home and cut the grass, so that I could test out my new Kobalt lawn mower. To my chagrin, a storm passed through right after I made it home and was about to begin mowing. I thought I'd have to wait until the following day to try out my new toy. Thankfully, though, the storm passed rather quickly without raining all that much. I decided to at least try to finish cutting my front lawn (it looked bad being halfway cut). Despite the grass being wet, the Kobalt 40-volt mower knocked it down without any fuss (I set the cut depth to the next to lowest setting). I loved how quiet the mower was and how light it was compared to my old gas-powered mower. Feeling confident, I decided to tackle my much larger (and wet) backyard (40ftx20ft). I wasn't sure if the 5-amp battery would be up to the task, but my concerns were put to rest. It handled the job like a champ. When I finished it, the battery still had about a full bar left. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and, as crazy as it sounds, can't wait to cut my grass again. The battery's longevity will, obviously, be the true test of satisfaction. I'm trusting it will last the test of time, so long as I take good care of it.The cherry on the cake is that I noticed this mower's price was discounted to $249 for Memorial Day on 05/16/2018 (just two days after I purchased it). I promptly took my receipt to the customer help desk at Lowe's for a price match and they refunded me $50!",

            "text": "First off was very amazed at how light the mower is!  Feels like it hardly weighs anything at all. It did a fantastic job on my lawn including some higher grass areas that I thought it may struggle with but it performed just great and I am very happy with it. I also like the fact that it is very easy to clean if you get wet grass stuck under it.  I just tipped it on its side and sprayed it out with a hose, no worrying about gas or oil leaking from the old style mower doing that, just hose and go!  The battery lasted perfectly for the size of my yard, and to top it off I also own the Weedwhacker so I can inter-change batteries as needed for bigger jobs!  Plus living in Hawaii, I definitely appreciate that it does not put out any pollution to run it, and it's a lot quieter than a traditional lawn mower, and I'm helping maintain a low carbon footprint by charging the battery through my solar set up!",

            "text": "Have been using a 40 volt Lithium ion trimmer for 2 years with great results. Based on this experience I decided to try the 40 volt Cordless Electric Push Lawn Mover to handle some, if not all, the trimming around my lawn.\nI unpacked the unit, set up the charger and battery and took the time to read the instructions while the battery was charging. I really like the features which allows simple height adjustment, not needing gas or oil or having to prime the engine, set the choke or to pull a cord. The safety switch is really important if small children are around and its use will become part of my routine even though we do not have any children present.\n My existing lawn mower is self propelled but is 3 times the weight and is difficult to use as a trimmer around trees and bushes. Both units have a 20 inch steel blade and therefore cut the same swat per pass.\nAfter I charged the battery, I simply installed it, set the safety switch and adjusted the deck height and I was ready to go. My lawn was about 4 inches tall and I used the new lawn mover for about 15 minutes before my wife wanted to try it. She normally does all the trimming and I don't think I'll get to use the new mower again because she thinks it is a dream to use and so much easier on her back.\nWe cut and trim about 2 acres utilizing a garden tractor, lawn mover and trimmer. This new unit will eliminate the gas lawn mower and about 80 percent of the trimmers use.\nWhen we were finished the battery still had power left. I still put it back on the charger so it would be at its peak next week.\nOver all I think this is more then enough lawn mower for the typical home owner. It came with a rear bagger attachment, simple to use mulching insert and a side discharge chute. This covers everything you may want the lawn mover to do. It is easy to use and easy to change attachments. \nAfter we finished I pulled the safety switched and battery, cleaned the underside of the deck, folded the handle and hung the unit up next to my other lawn tools.",

            "text": "Have used this mower 3 times. I wanted one that didn't need gas or oil. Decided on this one after reading reviews. I have been able.to mow on one charge. My lot size is small, 60 by 100, tract houses close together. The mower is very quiet. It is powerful enough to cut grass around 4 to 5 in high. I had to adjust to level 4 to cut higher, thicker grass in backyard. Engine speeds up when cutting thick area. Have a slope on side and partial one in front. Need to be careful if you have soil erosion or partly bumpy slope. My old mower was a gas powered front wheel drive self.propelled. I am 61 years old. Using a push  mower iz a little more demanding for me on the slope areas. The mower is still pretty light to push though.I have been able to finish the yard without recharging battery. I would not use this on wet grass as think would scratch up mower cleaning it. I think it does a good job on a small yard, is quiet, and like not having to keep gas and.oil in garage. Would recommend this mower to anyone with a smaller lot. Cons:Harder to push on a slope part of yard. Pro:No need for gas or oil, quiet, light weight for push mower, cuts well, height easy to adjust.",

I knew what I needed for that property and I knew what I needed for this property. For this small yard which takes 20 minutes tops, all flat, this is the right tool. I can get 2 cuts, 2 trims and blow sidewalks clear on 2 batteries. Quality is good, assembly easy for 40v push mower, weed wacker/string trimmer and leaf blower. My advice is know your requirements. If you are realistic about what this will do for you then it is great. How ever these tools would be useless for my last property with a large/long driveway, lots of trimming and finish mowing. Proper care of batteries and you will get 40 minutes of use. I read reviews when people said these products do not perform well, they perform well for small jobs. If the products are not delivering, the customer should have opted for equipment suited for the work they need to accomplish. I would recommend these products and would purchase all over again based on my experiences using them. I will update at end of Summer 19.

            "text": "There is almost nothing not to like about the Kobalt 40V mower. It comes in a box. I found it easy to lean the box on its side, then slit the bottom of the box as well as the top of the box. Then I positioned it so the bottom flaps were open and set the box down upright. I opened the top of the box, removed the loose materials such as the battery, batter charger, etc. I removed the packing materials, then lifted the box off the mower. It's not a heavy mower, but opening the box this way avoids having to lift the 40 pounds or so of mower up and out of the box. Easy for one person to do. Next, I read the simple instructions, then charged and installed the battery. Finally, I attached the handle, put in the mulch plug, put in the side discharge, set the height and the handle position, and was ready to go. Lawn mowers are pretty intuitive to operate these days and the Kobalt is no different. There is no need to go into the operation since the Kobalt operates like any modern mower. Starting and restarting is as simple as pushing a button and pulling back on the handle. Now for the good and bad. Not much bad. I have an 8 thousand square foot yard. I found I could mow about two thirds of it on a single charge of the battery. Since I'm older, I prefer not to mow the front and back on the same day. So, no problem with the operating time of the battery. The Kobalt has a 20 inch deck. Not the largest of cutting widths, but not bad. I love not having to go to buy (and then store) gas. Maintenance is very simple. Good power. Weeds, grass, and everything I need to cut is absolutely no problem. I just tipped the mower over on its side when I finished mowing, used a wooden spoon to clean out under the deck, and whisked the loose grass off the top. Nice to know that when I tip the mower on its side, I don't have to worry about gas or oil spilling out. Storing is a breeze. I can store it vertically with the handle folded in, but since I have the space, I just wheeled the Kobalt into the garage and into its place. I've had one battery powered mower in the past and find the two similar. The advantage of the Kobalt, for me, is the slightly larger cutting width and the fact that it ran a little quieter than the old one. Great product and highly recommended.",

            "text": "We bought this lawn mower three years ago and used it for two summers. It ran quietly and well, and we were happy about the fact that it's not gas-powered. We have used electric lawn mowers, either battery or corded, for several years.The battery didn't last nearly long enough to mow our front and back lawns even though we do not have a large yard and it only took about 45 minutes to do them both on a bad day when the grass was long and we were moving slowly. We decided in the end to spend an extra hundred bucks for an extra battery. It was too much of a hassle spending two days on the yard every week.So now the third summer of our lawn mower has arrived and the mower won't start. The battery is definitely not the problem since we have two, both are fully charged, and we've tried both. We called Lowe's and they said we have to call Kobalt to see about getting it repaired, which surprised me because I thought we were covered for five years. Kobalt said they need an \"item number\" from the manual that came with our mower before they could tell us anything about getting it repaired.We're thinking maybe this particular mower was a really stupid decision on our part. I do not recommend it.",

            "text": "This Kobalt lithium Ion mower is actually relaxing to operate! The quiet hum of the battery, the lightness of the mower when compared to a gas mower, the medium sized wheels and the push button/bail bar start make this mower fun to operate. I ran the mower for 50 minutes straight without a pause in power. I have another battery ready so in less than a minute I am up and going again. There is a larger mower that has two batteries already in the mower and is a 21 inch instead of 20 inch mower. No switching of batteries is necessary. This mower is presently $239 and the upgrade is $449. I personally don't think it would be worth $210 more dollars This 40-Volt must have a feature that kicks it into a higher power when you are in deeper grass. I experienced the extra power. The pros are 1) All wheel adjustment lever, 2) Easy start, 3) Quiet, peaceful motor, 4) Green, 5) No gas or oil smell in air and body/clothes, 6) No gas and oil purchases, and, 7) Mulch, bag or use discharge chute. This mower is for use in a home setting that has relatively flat lawns. Cutting your lawn no less than every other week should keep your lawn cutting experience an easy and enjoyable event. The price easily compares to a gas mower.",

It still works (even the batteries!), and I donated it to a friend for a charity yard sale. The only thing I didn't like was that it seemed the blades got dull relatively quick. I had two sets that I kept sharpened and swapped out. Anyway this new one is even better and a better value. It takes me about 30 minutes to mow my yard and when I am done the battery has two or three lights left of charge. The old one was mostly plastic. I like that this one has a metal deck and looks more like a traditional mower. It's like mowing my lawn with a box fan, so quiet. It's great to be able to do yard work and just smell like grass rather than gas exhaust. I also have the original trimmer and blower from 2013. At the time you got an extra battery free with purchase so I have a few 2.0Ah batteries to use with all these tools. All still work. Recently added the hedge trimmer to the arsenal. I also like the 5 year warranty. I don't think there are any gas mowers at this price with a warranty that long. Anyone with a small to medium size yard should look into this mower. Already had a neighbor borrow it and he's going to purchase one soon.",

            "text": "Purchased this mower for my son and his girlfriend who recently purchased a townhome with a small yard (1/4 acre). Very sturdy mower...nicely built. Light weight and easy to handle. Had it set up and ready for use in less than 10 minutes. Very fast battery charge. I offered to cut their yard because I wanted to try the mower out and see how powerful and quality of cut. I must say I was totally blown away by the ease of use, quiteness of motor and the quality of cut. My sons yard is very hilly and the cut remained even throughout and the mower was light enough to comfortably handle the pushing up and down the hills. Cut whole yard on the same charge and the mulch function worked extremely well with no clippings shown. Also bought a Kobalt battery edger and since the batteries are the same.....they can be interchanged as needed (backup).",

            "text": "I bought this mower about five weeks ago and have mowed my lawn in all sorts of conditions to really test this out. The first mow was super long grass, the second mow was short grass. Both using the side chute for clippings. Mow number 3 used the mulching setting on dewy grass. Mows 4 and 5 were mulching short dry grass.First things first, I bought the 40v trimmer along with the mower because I wanted an extra battery. Stupid me, I didn't check the AmpH to see that the trimmer batter was less than half the capacity of the mower. Trimmer battery lasts about 15 minutes in this mower. The mower battery lasts around 40.The main problem I have with this mower is battery life. I have a relatively small yard. In general, I should be able to mow and trim the whole thing in under 45 minutes. I have only once been able to do that using the two batteries I own on a single charge. The charge time on these takes so long that you can forget about charging while you mow, trim, or do other yardwork. Frustration with the batteries has turned what should be a simple job into a headache every weekend.Now, you may be thinking, \"hey, just buy another battery.\" That's a good idea. But that brings up the next problem: the price point. This mower was $279. For that amount of cash you can get a *very* nice gas mower. If I wanted to buy another battery for this mower equal to the capacity of the original mower battery, it would cost another $150. No amount of maintenance and fuel costs on a gas mower would ever bring the actual cost of this electric mower even remotely close to its gas counterparts. I really wanted to like this mower. I really wanted to go electric. But my goodness this actual cost is absurd. Honestly, I'm frustrated enough with the battery situation to give this a 1* review. However, everything about this mower \"works\" so you get a bonus star. Congrats on the pyrrhic victory.",

            "text": "I like nearly everything about this mower. From unboxing to a finished lawn was as painless as yardwork can be. The combo of minimal assembly and good instructions made for an easy start. The height adjustment was straightforward and required little effort. The battery is solid and compact. This mower is much lighter than comparable gasoline mowers. Mowing my hill was much easier than I expected as a result. There is a kill plug to prevent accidental starting during storage or when you're cleaning and maintaining the blade. One of my favorite features is the vertical storage ability. This reduces the garage storage space to about a 3'x1' rectangle on the floor and provides easy access to the blade for maintenance. The way it folds up allows you to move it around like a hand truck. The downsides are not many, but there are some. The battery takes a long time to charge, but it's not unreasonable. It advertises a 40 minute run time, which is about what it takes to do my lawn. I didn't run into any issues running out of power, but if your lawn is larger you may want to invest in additional batteries so you don't have to wait for it to charge to finish the job. The only other issue I see is the kill plug. The book says to remove the plug for storage, but there's no place to mount it so it's just sitting there under the battery cover. I feel it would easily fall out and get lost if someone wasn't paying attention. I may make a lanyard to keep it in place. Overall, if your relationship with small engines is like mine, this is a definite buy that you should feel good about.",

I do wish the battery was easier to remove and I'm unsure how long the plastic part that holds it in place is going to last but other than that I'm happy with the purchase.",

            "text": "Needed to replace my gas powered rotary mower so I decided to give this mower a chance. There are a few good points about this mower, but there are more bad points than good. The good points are; it's quieter to operate, seems to be well built, height adjustment is accomplished with a single lever, it's light weight and very easy to push and maneuver and when you release the lever, the motor stops quickly. When mowing is completed, it folds up very nicely and actually has an integrated stand, allowing you to store it in a smaller footprint. Being able to stand it up on end also makes it very easy to clean and service with no gas leaking out of a gas tank or oil leaking into the cylinder.  The BAD points are; low power, low rpm, which means that when trying to mow, the blade isn't spinning fast enough to \" lift \" the grass for cutting, which leaves a lot to be desired because you have to go over the grass multiple times in order to cut the grass, still leaving at least half the grass still laying flat and uncut. I was forced to use a leaf rake to lift large areas of grass so I could re-mow it, still leaving uncut grass. ( a gas powered mower has the necessary lifting power to raise grass up to be cut because the blade is spinning so much faster, producing enough lift / vacuum to raise up tougher grasses ) Having to go through the \" stupid person safety steps \" is annoying; you have to initially push a button, then pull on the \" bar \" before the mower will start. You cannot pull the lever first, then push the start button.  There is a momentary delay before the motor winds up and runs, just not fast enough to lift the grass for cutting.  I can see where this mower will work for certain yards, but for the majority of lawns, I highly recommend you stay with the gas powered mower if you want a nicely cut lawn.  In closing, I was extremely disappointed with this mower.  I will be returning it for a gas powered mower.  This is a good idea but before I'm convinced to go with battery powered mowers, they'll have to more than double the speed / rpm of the motor and the blade.",

I bought it two years ago and it ran great the first year, but this last year the battery's run-time got shorter and shorter. The battery got to the point that the charge lasted less than 10 minutes. I called Kobalt and was told that the mower was under a 5-year warranty, and the battery was under a 3-year. Kobalt directed me to their parts supplier, however, the battery I needed would not be available until the Fall. They offered two 20v batteries, but I didn't want that. To my surprise and without and without asking I was offered an exchange authorization. I exchanged my mower at Lowes for the 20\" Kobolt again without any fuss. I can't thank Kobalt and Lowes enough for the excellent customer service. I encourage everyone to always save your receipts. I always attach mine to the owners manual and save that in a safe place. Having my receipt made all the difference. The new mower runs like a dream. I can mow early in the morning without worry of waking neighbors who want to sleep in because this mower is quite. The extra inch on the mower's deck makes a huge difference and has decreased my mowing time.",

The chute I feel does not stay attached well enough to the rod such that a bump or two easily knocks the chute off of the mower--perhaps a good thing also as this could keep it from breaking--you decide. The battery is the only area where the mower is not great. It took quite a while to charge, maybe 45 minutes to an hour and lasted for approximately 30-40 minutes. This would be more than sufficient if you had a small area to mow (city lot, edging around flower beds/trees, etc). The mower itself seemed to work quite well and did a phenomenal job mowing under our trampoline with 2 ft tall grass, honestly it seemed to do a better job with this than it did with the grass in my yard which was dry and only a few inches tall. I did not use the bagger but imagine it would work just fine. I mowed using the chute and with the chute closed to function as a mulching mower. It worked great for mulching but required moving slower, as expected. Overall this is a great mower and with the right needs and circumstances I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. For my use, it will likely only be used to mow under the trampoline and for edging a fenceline.",

I appreciate the adjustable handle, I'm 6'3” and I don't have to bend down at all, a welcome change from my last mower. The 1 handle adjustable mower height lever is easy to use, and it has plenty of positions. The battery life varies, depending on how thick/tall the grass is. When it hasn't been too long and the grass is dry, it gets through my yard in one charge with no problem (about 30' x 70'). If I let it go too long, or the grass is damp, it takes 2 charges to get through. If you're like me, spend the extra $30 and get the exact same mower that includes the additional battery. The only quibbles I have is if the grass gets too long, I have to take narrow passes to avoid bogging it down and stopping the mower, or set it high to start and make 2 passes. My other issue is that the grass catcher doesn't do all that well. The grass sits low in the bag and ends up blocking the outlet, and most of the bag stays empty, so I just leave it on the mulch setting and it does fine.",

            "text": "I still love this mower but you need to be willing to make some trade-offs before you switch from gas.  I have a smallish 4200 square foot lawn. With this mower I need to mow more often, it doesn't mulch as well, and I need to keep the blades sharp all the time. Like I said, I still prefer this to the smell and noise of gas as well as keeping gasoline around the house. It's also much lighter and easier to steer. It just doesn't have the brute force of a gas mower.Mulching only works when you mow often. If you let the grass get too long it leaves clumps behind it unless you bag. It does kick up speed to deal with heavy spots but if it does that often it really wears down the batteries fast. The ideal height to mow again is such that it seldom kicks up to high power. If I let the grass get long I need to kick up the blade height and bag.  I bought a second set of blades and change/sharpen them every three or four times.I still prefer this to gas but this season with all the rain the grass has been growing like mad.  I've occasionally mowed twice a week to keep up. When I owned a larger home and big lawn I would not be able to use this.",

            "text": "Finally, an affordable, powerful, battery-powered lawn mower that really substitutes for a homeowner's gas-powered mower. This Kobalt 40-volt mower is the equivalent, in my estimation, of a 5-hp gas mower. Of course, you have to charge it, so it won't do a huge yard on one go, but for smaller yards, this is great, and you can always add an additional, comparatively affordable Kobalt battery to extend its range. Everything about this mower is tough, with an incredibly easy set-up and adjustment, right out of the box. Cutting height setting is a breeze. The wheels are sturdy and relatively large, and you can mulch or bag, depending upon your desires. The bag is high-quality and easy to handle. The mower build is sturdy and actually the mower is pretty heavy, but can still be wall-mounted. The best part is no gas with ethanol to ruin your engine. No oil to change and dispose of. No noise to deafen you and no smoke to choke you. No spark plugs to clean and gap. These were all tolerable back in the day when corded electric mowers were like a shock therapy experiment and battery-powered mowers were like toys. Things are different now. This thing really works. And it comes with battery, charger, bag, the whole works in one kit. There are other Kobalt tools that use the same charger and batteries, too, and that is a big plus! Maybe Kobalt will make a canister-vacuum in this 40-volt series at some point. That would be a great idea! By the way, I let my friend who is a landscaper try this out, and he was very impressed.",

            "text": "For several years, I've had my eye on these mowers and figured it best to wait several years for the technology to further improve and price to go down. Lowes was running one of those Spring Black Friday sales and the price was quite attractive. Combined with additional discounts, I decided to go for it. The lawn wasn't ready for its first mow until a few weeks afterwards but I was really looking forward to using this new machine.  Setup out the box is simple as it gets and charging the battery only took 2 hours to full charge.  Ergonomics are a definite strong point on this mower - the angle you can set the handle, combined with the curve of the handle and its padding make it extremely comfortable.  Folding the handle back onto itself so as to enable upright storage was a really nice feature.  The way that's designed makes moving the mower around real simple and is an excellent space saver in my otherwise rather crowded shed. As a bonus, the manufacturer 5 year warranty on the mower and 3 year on both charger and battery was very attractive.  With a fully charged battery, I dropped it into the slot where it clicked in nice and secure. Setting the wheel height with just one lever was an absolute delight! While the mower deck is all steel, it's nice and light enough to make it very maneuverable.  The unit's overall simplicity was wonderful and I really liked the color and appearance - so I was pretty excited to use it.Start up is a breeze - another strong positive. When it started, it did kind of mess with my senses as when you're used to a traditional gas powered mower, you expect a certain sound and feel. This thing is super quiet - quieter than a household vacuum cleaner - more positive points there. It does take a few seconds for it to come up to operating speed - which is different when you're used to instant power.  Shut down is also kind of different as the unit sort of winds down to a stop. As for the mowing performance, it's unfortunately here where it started to fall flat and continued to do so.  The lawn was getting its first cut of the season so some grass was not yet tall enough while others were about 4\"-5\" tall. The mower was set to cut at a 3\" height. Making my first passes, I immediately noticed the mower would not lift up heavier weighted leaves and mulch them like a traditional, gas powered push mower. That was surprising but I thought this being a bit different type of equipment so I gave it a little bit of a pass on that.  As I continued to mow into taller grass, which was slightly damp, the unit's motor would occasionally cycle to high revs to compensate for the additional power required and then power down when there wasn't so much of a need.  Continuing along, the taller grass wasn't mulching up as nicely as the traditional mower; lines of clumped grass dotted the yard.  And after a little while, the mower would come to a stop because the grass exiting the side discharge chute became clogged.  I'd have to remove the grass before I could continue. This happened several times.  So one weak point is a small side discharge opening, combined with a lack of engine torque, causes tall, damp grass to clog the unit and force it to stop.  By now, my lawn was going to give me more work to make it look good once I finished mowing.As I was 2/3 of the way through my (less than 5,000 sq ft mowable yard), I was thinking I'd give this mower one more try in a few weeks to see how it performs on a regular basis  However, no sooner did the thought occur when the unit just stopped working.  The reason was the battery completed depleted without warning.  (The battery was fully charged just before it was used.)  Unfortunately, that was the last straw.  I ended up taking out my trusty old gas-powered mower, finished the yard and made passes over the earlier grass clumps where everything looked as to what I've always expected from a mower.I really had such high hopes for this machine and it came extremely close to meeting my expectations.  However, the performance was unacceptable; I need a mower that will make my life and work easier - not give more to do.  Thankfully I was still within the 30 day returns window and was able to do so for a full refund.",

            "text": "To be honest, I just got this lawn mower and have only used it once so I am still in the honeymoon phase - but I LOVE IT!To start off after opening the box it probably took all of 5 minutes to set up, during which time I realized the wheel height adjustment for all 4 wheels is easily done with one super simple lever so I was already a happy camper.  After leaving battery on charger for maybe 15 minutes I had a couple bars and didn't want to wait to give Koba a try (that's her name, cuz well she's a girl, duh).  So I slapped the battery in, set the height, pushed a button and we we're off and running.  Immediately I noticed how easy it was to push with it's light weight and it was doing a great job giving a nice even cut to the grass (I did not get the self-propelled, and I don't know why anyone would unless maybe you have hills to deal with).  Next bonus that I wasn't really expecting was that it senses when you are going through some deeper grass and it speeds it's self up to get the job done - we have \"smart\" everything else, why not a smart mower.Quickly the rest of the story.  I have had a long time hate/hate relationship with lawn mowers.  Honestly I had pretty much decided they are just a disposable item and if I get 3 years out of them that was probably about all I could hope for.  Recently we purchased the house next to our house, so I now have 2 yards to mow, and my 3 year old (sir chugs alot) was about ready for the trash heap, so I treated myself to a riding mower (yeah me).  This still left me with a couple of relatively small backyards that I could partially get with riding mower (not yet named, I'm excepting suggestions), but I was still going to need at least some small mower to get portions of the yard, or better something just to do it all.  I realize the honeymoon might not last forever, and eventually Koba won't be quite as pretty, and might not perform quite as well as she once did, but I am hopeful and look forward to a long and happy relationship.  Seriously though, I would recommend this for anyone in the market for a new mower that has a yard you can mow in 30 - 40 minutes, or pick up a back up battery (the 40V 2.5ah is $76 at lowes) to help get the job done.  It's light weight and ease to use make it ideal for someone that is maybe not a 225lb guy like I am - but great for everyone.",

The point of a mulching mower is that it chops what is mown into tiny bits and deposits on the lawn as it mows. This is like fertilizing your lawn, slower but cheaper! I think the rear bagging is what many people think of as mulching. Yes, you can use the grass collected as mulch. Best use is to add to your compost pile as fresh green matter to be broken down. Mulching a border or garden with new grass clippings is okay but don't pile it on too thickly.",

I don't want to spend all day cutting my grass, nor do I want to spend an extra $150 on an extra 5Ah battery. Unless I can figure a way to mow it all with one charge, I will be returning this for a corded mower or gas. I do agree that we should consider the time of cutting the grass (or hours of charge) more than how much area is cut. Continuous cutting, mine lasted about 1-1/2 hours before needing a charge.",
