Throw pillows look great on it, but don't leave a whole lot of room for sitting.",

Going into the third spring season and ALL of the cushions have split, ripped and has completely fallen apart. Just passed the two year warranty on the fabric. It's an OUTDOOR set. Should be able to handle the elements. We even brought the cushions indoors for the late fall and winter months. I spent the money hoping for quality. Can't believe we only used it for two summers. I want a refund or Lowe's to provide a new set of cushions! They just shrugged their shoulders and said sorry.",

I love the peacock blue color and the cushions have a nice fullness to them.  I did have to take a steamer to the back pillows as the corners had been crushed into a wrinkled mess from packaging.  They look great now.  Assembly was fairly easy, especially if you use your own socket wrench for chairs and and Allen wrench for loveseat.  This will cut the time in half. Be sure to follow directions that say to tighten screws only halfway.  That is key to lining things up. Finish tightening at the end!",

I have been trying for two weeks to talk to someone about just getting my cushions replaced and I'm getting the run around. No one seems to know who the manufacturer is or who I'm supposed to talk to about replacing my cushions. I've called at least five different numbers and been transferred countless times. The website clearly shows I'm still under warranty but Allen + Roth is saying the warranty doesn't cover cushions exposed to elements. HELLO! It's outdoor furniture. I'm beyond frustrated and I refuse to pay $200 to replace my deep seat cushions for something that is out of my control. BUYER BEWARE!",
