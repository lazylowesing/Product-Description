Bought/installed these in each of our four bedrooms. So far so good. Fan puts out decent air while being almost silent. And the kicker...it has a light kit included with an led light. The led light itself is up for interpretation...but if it's not your preferred temperature it's an easy fix. I also bought the cable extensions with the fan and light bulb at the end. In my opinion it makes the fan look a million times better than the included chain pulls. Color me surprised with the value!",

            "text": "I have probably installed 50 fans in my life and this one was absolutely a pain that takes over and hour because of all the tiny screws that have to be mounted upside down and sideways. Usually ceiling fan blades have a catch for the two screws that mount the blade to the motor so they wont fall out as fast as you put one in. Fighting the blade with one hand and screw gun in the other left no hand to hold the stupid million screws. Once installed it works well. Led light is bright and has traditional size socket so replacement bulb should be fairly common when the time comes. But do yourself a favor pay a bit more for a fan that goes up far easier especially if your a rookie",

I have another fan in my den that I paid $200 for and this $39 fan is just as good as that expensive fan. It was super easy for my husband to install and it did not take long at all. The light is nice and bright and not dull like some others that I've had in the past. There were several Q and A's about a strong/bad smell coming from this fan after it is first installed and my fan DID NOT have a smell at all. I also saw several reviews that say it runs hot. My fan is on all night and it DOES NOT run hot. I plan on purchasing two more of these fans and would definitely recommend this fan to others.",

            "text": "When I purchased this item I didn't expect much; but I got much. It was easy to install; but mostly because I'd installed three ceiling fans before. I knew to prepare some items before hanging the motor: preinstalling some screws; removing some already installed screws; etc. We put this in a small spare bedroom and it works quietly, even when turned up all the way. The only extra thing I bought (as the ceiling light boxes are all installed to rafters, so a special box wasn't needed) is chain pulls with a small fan and a light, so the pull chains are easily detected even in the dark. A good buy for the money (and one we're going to put in at least three other rooms!).",

            "text": "Good looking for the price but i returned first one due to noxious smell emitting from motor. Company says motors were not “cured correctly from factory”  gave me three options to get a replacement.. i returned to lowes and purchased another in a different color hoping i would get a different batch. New fan still smells just not as strong. They advise me to leave it on for 72 hours to let cure. Before you leave the store open the box and get the motor out of the bag.. if it smells strong dont buy!!  Was gonna do 1 star but a real person answered customer service line in less than 5 minutes! So props to CS! Hopefully smell goes away. If it doesnt ill update my review!",

Immediately after installing this and letting it run for a few minutes we noticed the overwhelming smell of what I thought was wires burning but after reading through the other reviews we realized it's some sort of chemical or grease/oil burning odor that completely  filled our entire upstairs. It's an awful smell that isnt fading after letting it run for a few hours per day. The only good thing about this fan is that it is quiet and does move the air very well. I would NOT recommend buying this fan to anyone. Spend the extra $30-40 on a better fan.",

I found out instantly why it only cost $50.  This fan is horribly made.  The pieces of the fan would not fit together for the fan to function properly.  First the bracket mount would not fit flush.  So the cover housing would not fit flush to the ceiling.  After working with it for some time I finally got that to work.  Then once I put the blades on, they would not spin freely.  Why?  In order for the housing to fit flush it pushed the housing up causing the motor to hit the housing.  I had enough and took this junk back to Lowes.",

It was the best deal for this price but the stainless steel finish was what she was looking for. We love the single bulb use. Even the pull chains for the light and fan have the images of the light and fan on the end of the chains just so there's no guessing on which one you want to turn on. Installation is standard as most ceiling fans are. We love this fan and it added a great look for the room we had just painted and made into a den after our son moved out ( he built & purchased his first home). I highly recommend this fan while it's on clearance. Once they are all bought. I imagine that's all for this stock #. Way to go Lowe's!",

I installed it and after running it for 40 minutes, the room filled with a toxic smell that made my husband and I sick. We ran it for a few hours, hoping it would burn off, but it never did. We turned off the fan, opened the windows and aired it out overnight and the room still smelled. Had to take it down and install a new fan(different brand this time and not from Lowes), which was a royal pain. From the reviews and posts elsewhere on the internet, I am guessing that some but not all of these fans are toxic so buying them is a bit like Russian roulette. Now I know why the discount on them was so deep. I would give it a negative number rating if I could for all the effort and time it cost me. These fans present a health risk and Lowes should take them off the market rather than sell them at a discount.",

The paddles are the typical faux wood sticker-type wood grain although, from a distance, it's not so noticeable.  The darker wood color is definitely the better of the two as the lighter, more oak looking color seems a bit dated.  Other than that, my only other criticism is that the metal canopy part that hugs the ceiling and the metal ring to which the glass globe attach don't seem like brushed nickel to me.  They look more chrome-ish, and, for the name of the fan to be \"...Brushed Nickel...\", it seems to me that these two very visible parts should be brushed nickel.  Otherwise, it's a nice fan for a great price.  Installation is easy and straightforward, taking about 20 minutes from start to finish.",

Zero fan blade screws included, no pull chain ends, and no balancing kit. I made it work and reused screws from the original 36 in fan I was replacing. However, even on the highest setting (in either direction) this fan will barely blow toilet paper. Blade angle is good, but just no airflow at all. Called customer service and they had no clue what the high rpms should be. Mine is around 80. Also they could not send a balancing kit. I purposefully bought this fan for my small 10X10 room because I really wanted a lot of airflow. Now I have less than the old 36 with drooped blades.

I thought the smell would go away after a while and so we waited about 3 weeks and nothing.  Everytime I went into his room it smelled like chemicals.  I don't know what kind of stuff they used on this particular fan but its too much.  I had to return this product.  It is quite unfortunate since it is a nice design and the price is right.",

It subjects you to Lead Fumes!\nIt would be my guess that's what the odor is that you're smelling!\nIt's a shame something like this can even be sold to unaware customers in the US. Just FYI....Who Makes Harbor Breeze Ceiling Fans? Texas-based Litex Industries is an importer and manufacturer of several ceiling fan brands, including Harbor Breeze. Litex has an exclusive relationship with home improvement giant Lowes to distribute, market and sell the brand at is chain of stores. I'd rather spend another extra $100 or more for a ceiling fan for my Son's bedroom and know that he's not also breathing in Lead!",

I have no idea how your tenant installed the fan, but if the motor doesn't work, I would turn off the power to the fan and check to make sure the wire connections are secure. Especially, the black fan wire. It controls the fan motor. Many times the expansion and contraction of the wires due to turning on and off the light will cause the wires to work apart even with the wire connector on. Remove the wire connector and twist the wires together in a clockwise direction. Then turn the wire connector in a clockwise direction to secure the wires. Tug on the wires to be sure the wire connector is holding both wires in.",
