It works well, doesn't kink, and stays well coiled.  The end is bent a bit to help grab and retrieve, but I have found that the metal is a bit thin and flimsy.  The bent end unbends a bit too easily and straightens out with what I would consider a normal degree of pull.  It also gets stuck a little too easily.  However, it does do the job, especially for the price paid.",
