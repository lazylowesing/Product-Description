This happens a lot at our Lowe's. The fans are good. To balance you have to reverse but since they are indoor outdoor you have to remove the light cover to make the switch. The remotes feel cheesy but they work. Overall happy with the air flow.",

That gets a little involved when standing on an 8 foot ladder. The other issue is the light itself. Using LED's is great but only 2 small bulbs doesn't provide much light when mounted 9-10 ft. above the floor. Also the instructions say do not use any higher output/wattage bulbs.",
