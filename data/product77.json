I would find a stud but when I moved the device a few inches up or down the wall to confirm that I had found one, it would not detect it.  There are two potential explanations I can think of: 1) I never got the unit calibrated properly, or 2) the walls were thicker than this model can handle.  Without some indication from the device that it was properly calibrated, I had no way of knowing why it was not finding the studs properly.

I assume that most of the negative reviews come from people whose walls require a more expensive finder. Drilled 13 out of 13 screws through drywall straight into a stud. Keep in mind that this finder is not made for thick walls and I am sure it works best on dry wall. Perhaps if your walls are wooden, brick, stucco, plaster, thick dry wall, or whatever else walls are made of then you need to invest in a more expensive finder. But if you are like me and you have normal dry wall and you can't find the studs, then don't hesitate to get this one. At my Lowe's they even had a neat display where you could try this model out and one of the heavy-duty models. The display model seemed to work great for finding the edges of studs, and the one I bought is 100% on target so far.",

I read the directions multiple times and there was nothing for the problems. The product was taking forever to recahrge and was wasting my time. It took me at least an hour to find six studs. I would not recommend this to anyone. The price was outrageous for the quality and it needed to be free. Later it tried a better model by the same manufacturer and it did not work either.

Finally with the best determination using the device, there was no stud where it claimed. I wish that I would have read all the negative reviews before I purchased this--I wouldn't have bothered. But it was not expensive, and I thought that the technology would have advanced since the old stud finder from years ago that I was used to that actually worked. Obviously it hasn't. Considering that a few of the reviewers were happy with their purchase, this indicates a severe failure in quality control to me, rather than a total failure of design (I'm an aerospace design engineer).

Well i checked twice and screwed once. I stsrted in a area i knew that there was no stud and slowly slid it along the wall in till it beeped the marked with a pencil. After that i took it off the wall and moved it a few inches ti the other sife and brought it towards the pencil mark intill it started beeping again and marked it with a pencil then i knew that was the stud.  I will confess i did have to make about six extra drill holes in the wall tring to screw into the studs. Once i firgured that the studs were marked correctly and my tape measure skills were off about half an inch due to not factoring in the side wall of the cabnet i was able to screw into the studs where my marks were on the wall. I have found over the years most issues are operator and not the tool.",

Please replace the battery with a brand new 9V alkaline battery with an extended expiration date a few years out. Stud finders require adequate voltage to power the sensing mechanism inside the tool. If you try this and are still having issues, please contact us.
