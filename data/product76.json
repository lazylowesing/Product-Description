Waited till next day and then used it to hold a very heavy bass ship's helm to the wall.First anchor I used was tightened too much and the anchor started to tear the drywall and pushing out because the strap used to hang an item was not long enough to fit flush with the wall",

The only time I've had them fail is when I've tried to use a larger screw than the one included. There was a time I actually had the anchor strip out inside the drywall and that's not an easy thing to make happen, yet, I managed to do it. I would suggest using the screws included or at least find the equivalent diameter screw in whatever application you need. I realize there are times you need larger circumference coverage and might have to use a washer, etc. to account for certain circumstances.",

            "text": "Actually, I wpuld rate more on the order opf 4.5 stars, but am taken with the approach.  Unlike trtaditional plastic drywall anchors, that are pushed into a pre-drilled hole and expand on use with a suitable screw, EZ-Ancors actually screw into the drywall themselves, creating their own grip in the substrate, they also feature an external face, which [prtevent them from being susceptible from pushing through the wall.  Manufacturer indicates that no prior drilling is needed, but I would recommend driling at least an 1/8\" pilot hole to assist in locating the anchor, as well as easing the initial cutting into the surface.  actually, I have used a 3/16\" to further facilitate penetration of my rather hard, 60-year-old walls.  One precaution, I first saw these in a video whereby they were driven into the wall using a phillips bit in a power drill.  It can be done, but set adjustable torque rather low, as the head of the anchor strips out rather easily.  Another limiting factor is that the head of the anchor is 0.5 inch in diameter, which one must consider both in terms of space to install, and whether will be revealed by a narrow fixture.  And lastly, despite what the video indicated, I would use the supplied screws, OR if using washer-head cabinet screws, use one size larger than #8 th video depicted.  The #8's do not seem to fully expand the anchor, reducting their fnuctional untily, in my opinion.",

Second attempt was after I pre-drilled a hole the same dimension as the anchor drilling tip.....2nd anchor wouldn't screw into the sheet rock, and it also shattered on the attempt to screw it in. Got a third anchor and it functioned normal in the 1/2 inch sheetrock. Needed to install a second anchor and also had to pre-drill the hole in the sheetrock. Again....trouble getting the anchor to screw into the sheetrock but it finally grabbed and anchored itself. When the screws were installed, the anchors appeared to function as advertised, but I am not happy with the final results. Limited the weight on the anchors due to some minor damage to the second anchor on installation. I won't buy this product again.",

The maximum weight capacity for using this anchor to hang an item in 1/2 inch drywall is 75 lbs. for items hung flush to the wall. The weight capacity may be less for items hung out from the wall, like shelving. The condition of the drywall can also affect the weight capacity.
