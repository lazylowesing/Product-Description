This puts added stress on the post and will eventually loosen up the dirt around the post. I will make one out of stainless steel to avoid this problem. It will also assist in closing of the box due to the fact you have to push equally as hard to close it. Some pop-rivets and silicone should keep it water proof. Would be nice if it was maybe one gauge thicker material, it is a large box.",

While it looked very much the same, I was struck by how the quality had deteriorated. The door fits poorly -- so poorly that the company had drilled an off-center hole at the hinge just to get it attached. The hinge had two holes, one originally stamped in the door and a second drilled off center to get the door to match the box. The lower seams in the box were sloped so that the box did not fit well on the post. The box is serviceable but is disappointing for the $30+ price.",

It's really nice that that the postman can leave a large package in this oversized mailbox, instead of leaving a notice to come by the Post Office and pick it up.I have lived in my house for 30 years, and replaced my mailbox twice, each time with the same kind. A quick division will tell you that each one has lasted 15 years. The two that failed both had the same problem -- the door would not say closed. After about 15 years, the door gets bent a little bit, and the \"latch\" that's supposed to hold it closed is pretty much worthless. They have changed some other small aspects of the design, including replacing some metal parts with plastic, but have never addressed this problem, so I predict that this third one will also last about 15 years. The do not offer parts. You must replace the whole mailbox.Still, a 15-year life is not that bad.",

Between the box and the house numbers I purchased for the sides, I spent over $50 for a product that will not last two years. I'm looking at replacement door kits, but for a box this size, they start at $55.

Too many times to count, I have picked up the mail and found an envelope folded in half, creasing my photos.So, when I saw this at Lowes I said, \"Hey, that's a BIG mailbox\". It sure is. It's made from thin gauge sheet metal, so it's a little wobbly before it's attached to a piece of plywood. That's what I recommend; screw or nail a 1/2\" piece of plywood to the base (there's a perfect spot for it), then attach it to your post. I love the size of this thing, no more folded envelopes. Drawback is that I can't reach the back of it from the car window, so I have to park to get the mail.I'm going to spray paint the interior with Rust-oleum in white to brighten it up, and to seal it from the rain. The factory finish on this mailbox seems thin, so I'm trying to head off the rust.I do wonder, since I live in the country, if the large size will make it a target for baseball bats!",

We have had this box for three (3) years and the plastic closure latch has broken off. The only location to purchase a replacement is on the Solar Group Website for $15. And it is plastic also.

If we had drilled holes to mount a box number sign on top of the box, we could understand the presence of rust, but there are no holes. A similar box at our old office is in better condition than this one (1) and it is fifteen (15) years older. We make check the manufacturer of this older box to try to locate one (1) elsewhere.

Got it home, opened the box, and the mailbox was badly dented in the left rear corner including dents to the base. Since the box was totally undamaged, I can only assume the product was damaged when it was packaged at the factory. Additionally, when it was painted, you could tell it was painted after the door was attached, and there were spots behind the hinges that were not painted. Over all, I believe the quality is lacking.",

            "text": "I have had this mailbox for approximately 10 years. The door rivets have broken off but not due to wear and tear. The mailman got too close with her vehicle and knocked my mailbox off the post. TWICE! My mailbox has been hit when kids on their golf carts lose control of the vehicle. The kids have knocked my mailbox and broken the post holding it numerous times. I have had to replace the wooden post 7 times in the past 10 years but my mailbox keeps surviving. My husband has even backed his vehicle into it when there was a heavy fog morning and he couldn't see it. LOL! I have accidently pulled the door completely off when it got covered with ice last Winter and froze the door shut. I fixed the door by screwing a 3 inch screw into the hole where the rivet had been broken off. I used a wooden mounting base on the mailbox so the screw worked great. I now have to replace the mailbox because vandals and thugs who moved in the neighborhood have shot my mailbox to pieces so the door will no longer close. I am replacing the mailbox with one like it again. Other than getting shot up, my mailbox held together through all the hits and knockdowns it has received over the past 10 years. Mailman still folds up my mail (like magazines) so it will fit into the mail tray she uses in her vehicle.  This mailbox is huge! Now she can fit all the junk mail, bills, magazines and medium size boxes into my mailbox without problems. I will recycle it into a garden storage box to store my many hand garden tools. I love this mailbox! It has proven to be a sturdy one!",
