Very good instructions, and fit my application perfectly.However, the hardware bag had serious quality issues. There were only three of the four required #10-24 x 1 3/4\" screws. I had to go back to the store to get replacements. Also, two of the four required #8 x 1 3/4\" galvanized wood screws already had the heads stripped (definitely weren't new screws). I was fortunate enough to have a few spare wood screws available at home to replace these.Overall, this is a good product and I would suggest it to a friend. But I would suggest you ask a store representative allow you to inspect the hardware bag before leaving the store.",

            "text": "I purchased this to mount a lockable metal mailbox. The mounting bracket is well made for mounting a mailbox to a 4x4 post. However, it could use some improvements for mounting to an arm.First, the mounting hardware. Since the turned-down parts for attaching to a 4x4 post interfere with placing it directly on the arm of a post with arm, it includes plastic spacers. I did not like this as it seemed as if this would not be as strong as if the bracket were able to sit directly on top of the arm. I ended up modifying the bracket to flatten out two of the tabs so that the bracket could sit directly in contact with the arm. I was able to then use the holes in the tabs plus some of the other holes in the bracket to attach the bracket to the arm. I also did not like the small nuts and bolts provided for attaching the mailbox. I had some heavier ones which I wanted to use. I drilled out four of the holes in the bracket to allow for the larger bolts. I also decided to use two lag screws to go through two of the holes in the box, through the bracket, and into the arm to reinforce it even more. Since the holes in the box did not line up with the holes in the bracket, I marked and drilled two new holes in the bracket.After finishing the job, the mailbox is very secure. It would be very difficult for someone to try to remove the box from the arm, especially since there is no space between the bracket and the arm into which someone could place a pry-bar.The only thing I would change on the bracket would be to lengthen the tabs on the sides of the 4x4 cut-out which face the center from the long sides. If they were longer, then screws could be put in from the sides without them being angled up enough so they come through the post in the middle. It would be better to have them go in level. It would also be good to be able to drill all the way through the post and use a long bolt and lock nut to attach the bracket to the post. A longer tab would make this possible.",

I secured the mounting board with two screws in each side.  It would have been nice if the screw holes were offset from the holes on the adjoining side.  In other words, the sides opposite one another might be, say, one inch down from the top, and the other two sides opposite one another could be, say, 1.5 inches down from the top.

I was impressed that most of the screws, nuts and washers were stainless steel - so not rust worries. The nuts for the screws that attach the bracket to the box have nylon inserts so these will not work themselves loose like my old ones did. All the hardware came sealed in a plastic bag and nothing was missing. There was a very clear instruction sheet with diagrams showing the various types of posts and how to place the bracket on each.
