We're big fans of the wicker look and we love having all these pieces. We can use the ottomans for extra seating or put trays on it and use it as a side table. The cushions are firm but thick and comfortable. This set looks great with the fire pit also purchased from Lowe's. I would definitely buy this set again.  It's a good thing they were out of them or I probably would have. Life is good.",

I asked the delivery guys to put the box on my back porch, so I wouldn't have to drag each piece back their on my own.  They said no problem and they even called me once they had delivered it.  After spending weeks looking at various conversation sets, this was definitely  the most comfortable set I sat on.  The cushions are thick yet not overly firm.  An added advantage is the sunbrella covers on the cushions.  Oh, and the covers can be removed for easy cleaning. The color is beautiful and goes with any decor.  My only concern when ordering it was that I would have to put it together.  Well, that was not worth the time I spent worrying.  I got the whole thing put together in less than 2 hours, by myself.  The ottomans come assembled.  I am extremely pleased with this and would recommend it to anyone looking for fairly inexpensive outdoor furniture.",

I looked at multiple sites and for the price point and overall ratings I felt this set was the best. We have been quite happy with the product. I set it up and there were a few bolt holes that didn't line up properly but I just am persistent and undo other that I have already bolted to move the holes more into alignment. We have used it multiple times since purchasing and its quite comfortable- cushions are firm but not overly so. The rattan is nice and the frames are very substantial. Haven't had any problem with cushions blowing away - they arent attached to the frames but seem heavy enough to not blow off unless we actually had wind.",

Add the matching dining table to this set and voila - I have both.  The pieces are large and comfortable in my opinion, but still lightweight and easy to move.  The set is very versatile, as the ottomans can be used as extra seating.  The cushions are firm but comfortable, Sunbrella fabric (yay!), and zippered.  As for my assembly tips...  trying to put this together using the little allen wrench that comes with the set is difficult.  My advice - get out your ratcheting socket wrench and buy a hex socket bit for it.  Take along one of the bolts to the hardware store so you're sure you get the right size socket.  SO much easier.  My other tip is that you shouldn't completely tighten up the bolts until you have them all started about halfway.  If I tightened one section all the way, then the next piece wouldn't line up easily.  Once I loosened them, then I could get the other pieces lined up and attached.  Once it's all together, then go around and alternate tightening up all the bolts on the piece.  Hope this helps others assembling their purchase...I'm very happy with mine.",

This set is everything I was looking for and more. It was easy to assemble, fits nice in the space I had on my deck, is easy to clean, and quite comfortable.

We live in North Florida so we knew we needed something that would be weather proof. The sunbrella fabric is perfect for Florida and the wicker is holding up quite nicely. For those that left bad reviews because the holes don't match up, this is due to the overtightening of the screws before the chairs are completely aligned and ready to be tightened down. It took us a bit to get them perfectly screwed down, but if you take your time and only loosely screw in each side, you will be fine. Anyone who has put together furniture knows that you cannot overtighten before the products has ben completely built. I especially love the adjustable feet, our patio is a bit uneven, with this feature we were able to make sure the chairs don't rock when they are sat it,",

There's all kinds of messy welding around the screw holes, so it's clear the precision is not there. But the metal is very sturdy and the welding of the parts seems strong. On the whole, the quality of the set is so good, for the price, that I will be heading to the hardware store for nuts and bolts to put where the provided hardware does not fit.",

I am still confused as the Lowe's Manager Wayne at Ray Road store, Phoenix, says this product's cushions are Olefin and NOT the usual marine-grade Sunbrella fabric used and that it was \"probably\" made that way by Sunbrella as special order for Lowes. He also said the 5 year limited warranty on this item refers to to the base aluminimum frame of these pieces and has nothing to do with the fabric or cushions. Is that true or not, do you know? I know this fabric doesn't \"feel\" like the other Sunbrella pillows I have always purchased--seems softer and less plastic feel, so is it Olefin or not?",
