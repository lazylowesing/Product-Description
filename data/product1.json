The ergonomic grip does make a difference & is surprisingly helpful.\nAlthough I originally wanted a hammer solid forged shaft, I really couldn't recall or personally knew of a hammer head flying off. So, the value just wasn't there when comparing this fiberglass handle model's quality feel which is also a lighter load on my tool belt.\nYou know you made a good choice when you keep playing with the tool...and thats what Ive been doing with this hammer.",
