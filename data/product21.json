            "text": "I'm actually not writing a review on this specific product, but on the packaging of this product at my local Lowe's store (Crestview, FL).  This chair is the product that was in the box that I brought home from Lowe's 2 days ago and I guess, might be a perfectly good product if it's what you're looking for.  The reason for my 2 stars is because the packaging is deceptive and is requiring a return to the store.  The 1st picture below shows the box that I brought home from Lowe's and the 2nd shows the insert that includes assembly instructions.  Both clearly say Garden Treasures Vinehaven \"swivel rocker\" chairs. I am unable to find Vinehaven swivel rocker chairs listed on Lowe's site.  The site does show Garden Treasures Elliott Creek swivel rockers which is what I will order once I return the chairs that I have.  (They are not available at my Lowe's) As soon as I unpacked the box, it appeared pretty evident to me that there was no \"rocking\" feature on these chairs.  The 3rd, 4th and 5th photos below show the base of the chair, the plate thing that attaches to the bottom of the chair and fits into the base and the bottom of the chair where the plate attaches to the chair.  Nothing that I could see would have the chair rock!  I decided to put one together just to be sure that I wasn't missing something.  Assembly was very easy.  After unpacking the box, it took about 10 minutes to assemble one.  All hardware was included.  But, IT DIDN'T ROCK!!  We specifically wanted chairs that rocked.  Rocking is more important that swiveling for us.  So the assembled chair and the box containing the parts for the second chair, the cushions, instructions and remaining hardware are all in the back of the truck ready for a trip to return them.  What a pain.  I paid $178 for these chairs which I guess is a pretty good price. They were originally $198 and were on sale.  The ones that I'm going to order are currently listed at $208.  $30 is a small price to pay for some decent chairs that actually rock!  I realize that the deceptive or incorrect packaging is not a Lowe's issue but rather a Garden Treasures issue.   I just want to make others who may see this product in their local store aware that it likely is not what it appears to be.",

We've only had this set 2 MONTHS and after only the second rainfall, THIS is what happened! This is the worst, there are more stains throughout the furniture area, but this is the worst and the most recent. This is pitiful and everyone that has experienced this should get replacements and financial assistance for repairs on their decks, although other than replacing the planks there is nothing else really to do, the rust stains DO NOT COME OUT.

We've had one set over a year and aside from some of the bumpers falling off the bases (typical for any such furniture) we've not had an issue.

I took the chairs back for an exchange (aggravating) and Lowe's (who is very good about this) brought me an exchange in an undamaged box.  I came home, assembled the chairs and initially congratulated myself for a good decision, until it rained.  The pillows were like sponges.  I mistakenly assumed since they were deck patio chairs the pillows would be weather resistant; no where in the adds or directions in the box does it indicate the pillows must be removed for incriminate weather. I currently have them in the laundry room drying out (we're on the third day).  The chairs (so far) seem well built but the pillows are the reason for my three stars.
