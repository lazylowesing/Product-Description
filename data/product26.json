            "text": "Finally posting a review after using it fully for a few months and couldn't be happier. After trying a few other brands,they just do not ‘ring' true and suffered either poor feedback or complicted functioning. Out of the box,the Nest cam is packaged really beautiful and organized very nice especially for a neat manic like me. Even the screws,wire clips,and plastic drywall anchors are in a separate tiny box and are so cleverly and neatly packaged,it's almost and art form of organization.Set up was boom fast and the most time consuming part was the placement and concealment of the electric cord(tried the battery route and did not get good results and had to keep charging the battery pack ). All you do to mount the camera,is place the metal mounting bracket in your preferred location,do a test w camera pluggged in to insure a good view,screw bracket in place,attatch magnetic top cap and attatch camera! You download the app and connect your wifi and boom! it is done. Easy peasy and great video feed. Very clear,no circles of loading death, and notification on activity if you want. I purchased 2, one for the dog run and one for the front of house. If they go on sale again I def will get a few more. I also tested the video feed from @ 40 miles away and I could see and hear everything clear and non choppy with no interference.The only drawback is the low volume when you talk via the micro phone. You do hear a voice but not really loud enough for major attention.I tried to tell the dogs not to bark via the app on my cell,and they kinda did,kinda do not respond and when I tested it myself to hear it was kind of low but noticeable. Overall,this is by far the best security cam I have encountered. Also love the sleek design and simple ability to adjust the angle if needed using the magnetic base. This to me is just another layer of security that I can control and really use on a daily basis. Technology can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but if this 50 something can do it than anyone can.",

This is better than Ring, Ring only records the actual motion at the time of incident. Nest records all day so if you get a alert you can scroll back a little and also zoom in the subject. It also let's you know if it's just motion or a person. The installation is not bad, the app wasn't as easy as ring though. But it's pretty straight forward. When you get it working it may go offline, if that happens just unplug it wait a bit then plug back in, that cured mine and it works perfect now.",

In order to do so, I have a network extender to allow the signal strength to be sufficient to provide the bandwidth needed for 24/7 monitoring. Unlike the indoor version, these units should be left on all day. I suggest installation on the soffit of your roof and feeding the cable into the attic where you can provide electrical service. This provides a dry climate for the electrical portion of the camera. You may need to have an electrician install outlets in your attic which while not inexpensive is IMO the best way to install them. Video quality is equal to the indoor cameras and the mount is easy to install and position. It is best to have the camera out of reach so would be intruders can not reach it easily. I highly recommend the NEST product line their support service is nothing short of outstanding.",

            "text": "I am assuming people who buy this are already familiar with the nest cam indoor. For those who don't, here is the breakdown of the nest cam indoor:-1080 Full HD recording, will scale down automatically based on signal to improve smoothness of video-microphone/speaker system, so you can hear what the camera hears and also talk through it-8 infrared LEDs, for night vision-external LED for status, can be turned on/off- 24/7 continuous recording so nothing is missedThe Nest Cam outdoor improves upon the indoor version by being both outdoor rated as well as having redesigned wifi antennas for greater range since it will most likely be placed outside the home where signal isn't too great.The install is like a regular nest cam except instead of having a standard USB wall plug charger, where you can just plug in a micro USB into the charger to power the nest, the Nest outdoor has a wire portion that is permanently attached to the camera (still a USB standard wire though) that attaches to a USB charger, but this time it is a puck that is attached to an equally long 120v wire that plugs into your home outlet. With this design, it is very unsightly to install indoors, although I \"hack\" all my nest cams by cutting the wire, feeding it through a hole I drill in the wall, and splicing it back into a normal USB end with small gauge wire nuts. The outdoor comes with a couple clips that you can use to screw the cable against the wall which I didn't use since I routed the wire into the wall.Quality is unsurpassed, although the white shell is plastic, it is a smooth matte that wont scuff easily. The rest: Glass lens, stainless steel hardware, etc. Seriously if you want proof of Nest's apple-esque attention to detail, just look at the stainless steel screws. Perfectly machined and polished. The app is great as well. Nest recently updated the Nest app so it is even better than before, you can scroll through the video timeline and you can basically fast forward all the footage in the past 10 days. Nest also debuted the \"Person Aware\" which is their algorithm for detecting humans to cut down on false alarms by car headlights etc. It works pretty well, but 1 out of ever 10-15 times, a bug flying by will still be mistaken as a person. Still, for a brand new algorithm, it's false positive rate is very impressive and will continue to get better with future updates.Some \"criticism\" that isn't really criticism: yes it has a wire, yes a wire can be cut, but if a thief really wanted to get into your house, whether you have a wire free, wired, waterproof camera, it really does not matter, they will disable/destroy it either by hitting it, cutting the wire, spray painting the lens, or wearing a mask. So the complainers who keep bashing on the \"wire that's easy to cut\" really need to focus on the important point which is: if a thief is going to destroy/disable your camera, a camera needs to be good enough to alert you to a person in it's view and also save all the footage for you to view anywhere in the world, which the nest does. If someone does cut your nest cam, you can easily view the last moments on the app and call the police. Wired or not, it makes no difference to a determined thief, but it does make a difference to you, because now you'll never have to replace the batteries and your nest will pretty much keep an eye out 24/7/365 without you having to do much maintenance.The nest cam system as a whole gets a lot of detractors who hate it because they cannot afford the monthly subscription fee. What do you think pays for the continual app updates, like the timeline update, or the \"person aware\" algorithm update? Or the storage fees for storing all the data on secure cloud so you can view it anywhere in the world? Is there a subscription? yes. Is it worth it? you bet it is, especially since having 4-5 top of the line cameras is still hundreds cheaper than getting a security system from a \"professional\" company.In the end, if you have the money and a sense that safety and security is always worth it, than the nest cam system is pretty much the standard for high end smart cams. The Outdoor Cam does not replace the indoor version, rather extends the family so the whole house can be covered.",

It's also a bummer that you have to pay for nest aware to get the \"extra\" features that are already built into the camera. I do really like the camera but I will be hard-pressed to purchase another one as it would leave no badnwidth for the other devices on my network. If I had a larger connection I would be more likely to buy another one.",

I do wish I could control the motion level it records, when it's windy it records waving bushes and trees. I did have to cover up the little green light, it attracted bugs at night and would set off the recording all the time.  Other than these little things, it is easy and works.",

I wired this camera in to a separate breaker in my home as I wanted no interference electronically by wiring to anywhere else. Had a power outage which came back just a fed minutes later which for some reason left the security camera off. When I flipped the breaker I had to go about re-setup through the app of the WHOLE system again which is a huge inconvienence given the camera is set up so high outside and the barcode to scan to resetup is on the back of the device it's self. Making it not only dangerous rescanning alone but HUGELY inconvenient.Not my least favorite of the Nest products but I will still be replacing ALL of them with another product. Thermostat. Doorbell camera. Secruetoy camera. All being returned for their competing products. I regret these purchases very greatly.",

These cameras are easily hacked and the hackers can access your network and take down all security. I also found out they can manipulate your video quality and night vision. This is an unsafe system! The best security is a wired system as most things WiFi or Bluetooth can be hacked and disabled. They are high priced toys. As far as Nest support they refuse to talk in writing or leave a message. I own 4 of these cameras and would love my money back. I also own 3 nest protects and 2 nest thermostats I have also had problems with those turning temp to 50 in simmer and 90 in winter...they have been hacked or bad also....nest protect is only thing I haven't had a problem with yet...all this has happened in less than a year...had a camera replaced and a thermostat...if you need proof I have it and I'm very experienced with this product....",

It installed, set up and work just as promised in the instructions. I am older and not tech savvy, so this was a real treat. I had preconceived thoughts of bringing this back to the store. The only reason I will go back will be to buy more cameras or security products from Nest. The picture quality, audio features, zoom and pan and scan, ease of use and all the apps work well. I should have gotten one of these years ago. Hoping the yearly fee is worth the cost, but for me its already paying for itself. Caught 2 people trespassing the first day. Easy to hide also.

Connecting it to my home's Wi-Fi was also easy and the phone app is very user friendly (both the camera and thermostat are connected to one app which is awesome). Additionally, the camera has a great night vision sensor and capability. The microphone and speaker work as advertised, however there is a slight delay in the voice transferring from your phone to the camera...but that's to be expected and, for me, does not downgrade it's capabilities at all.

For the start, I didn't have any problems setting it up. It was easy and fast! The interface or UI for Nest is also really easy to navigate to. My mom who isn't all that savvy with technology can navigate on it. The quality of the video is also unbelievable. And with the Nest Aware, I love the fact that you can create timelapse and of course keep video for in my case 5-days. In the case, in the future, if I need to provide evidence to the police of a home invader. I started with one camera and now I'm fully invested with the Nest Eco. I now have 5 cameras including the new Nest Hello. I'll be adding two more to complete the coverage of my house.",

The picture quality is excellent and the installation overall was a breeze. The only limitations that I see with the camera is the picture quality and the location of the camera is limited by your wifi signal. In addition, if you are going to run the cable from the camera to the USB junction box through a wall, it will require a 7/8” hole. I would recommend both this camera without hesitation.",

I enjoy those products and this one is no different.Yes, the camera's power cable is exposed, but if you follow Nest's recommendations and be smart about it, then this cable should be hard to located and cut. I don't want to have to worry about batteries. I need my camera to work 24/7 without fail.Setup was a breeze. A lot easier than I thought. I was able to mount the camera under an eve and route the power cable neatly to the power outlet thanks to the cable clips. The strong magnets hold everything in place and allow for easy adjustment of the camera as well. Adding the Nest Cam Outdoor to my account was just as easy. I was up and running in less than an hour.The video stream is clear. The night vision is spectacular, as it lights up my entire front yard, which is decent sized. I love the new eyesight feature, being able to scrub through the day very quickly. I also like how it detects people and shows you a thumbnail. Overall this is a great camera and adds a lot of value to my home automation system.Yes, it costs money for 10 or 30 days of video history. I'll gladly pay the $200/year for all three of my cameras if it means the safety and security of my home and family. If you want quality service, you need to pay for it. Bottom line: if you love Nest and their indoor cameras, you will love this as well. No more pointing an indoor camera out the windows for me.Also the Police loved the quality of the camera picture it was because of the quality of the picture along with the time of the day time line showing in the video that the police was able to catch a person whom took an item from my yard.",

Once I get it set up I never have to mess with it. Wireless connectivity is extremely long compared to competitors and setup is extremely easy. I don't know how many other \"smart\" products that can't even get past app setup. So for the high price, you get quality, reliability, looks good, and just works.

However, if you're looking for a camera that you can monitor without paying a for a monitoring subscription this camera may not be for you. You get a 30 day free trial with the full features of the camera, after that subscription  ends, it leaves much to be desired. Personally I've noticed that:-you can't access the full screen feature- if it detects motion it'll take a still photo rather than video, you'll still be notified however. This doesnt always capture the object that triggered the motionI'm sure there are other drawback I haven't found yet.

Got the first one installed easily and it worked fine so I installed the second.  Pictures are clear and the wide angle lens covers my front and back yards well enough.  Only criticism is that they are almost too sensitive.  Get repeated alerts for moving tree limbs, flying insects,  and birds.   Guess it's a good problem to have!!",

            "text": "When we purchased our new home I looked into several brands and tested quite a few others that friends owned. In the end, I bought two outdoor and one indoor Nest cams. Installation was a breeze, and even though it took me a couple of hours to mount the outdoor cams, it was still a relatively simple project. I chose to drill through my siding to plug in the outdoor cams indoors for security reasons, so I just wish they'd make a smaller middle power connector so I could've drilled a smaller hole. Really, that's my only \"complaint.\" The app is so much better than any of the other cameras I tried, but most especially my old ATT Digital Life app for viewing my old security cameras. Not only is the app intuitive, but it's been very reliable so far. Then again, I'm only two weeks in, but no hiccups, yet. I'm happy so far and considering getting a fourth camera.",

Again, replacing a Uniden camera - just one though.  I was pleasantly surprised when I realized the viewing range covers my entire back yard and not just half, like with the old camera!Being able to have video store online, in the cloud, is a great option for security purposes.  Being able to create videos is another great feature.You won't be sorry for purchasing one, or two..... :-)We view ours from our smartphones, iPhone 8Plus and Samsung 8Plus, iPads, PC's and Alexa.   With Alexa, we can view the camera feeds on our 65\" TV, with the Nest feature.

            "text": "I have purchased two NEST Outdoor Cameras in the past month.  One each for different sections of my home property.  Set up and installation of the cameras was very easy.  The instructions were easy to read and follow.  I recommend planning out your installation location paying specific attention to power supply availability and viewing area due to obstacles.  I drilled 1 inch holes through my stucco walls and placed a one inch PVC pipe through the hole.  I then ran the electrical cable for the camera through the PVC pipe.  The power cable fit perfectly.  I then plugged the cameras into indoor electrical outlets.  I love the magnet mounting system for this camera.  It makes for a sturdy mount and makes it easy to adjust the camera angles.Video quality for me has been great; day or night.  The camera has a very good night time capability.  I monitor the video feed from my main home computer and two Smart phones.  I have found it easy to go back and watch previous video feeds and make video clips when needed.  The 130 degree viewing area allows me to see a large section of my property from this stationary camera.Overall I am very happy with my purchase of the NEST cameras.  I would highly recommend them.",
