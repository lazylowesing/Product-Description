            "text": "This is the best exterior paint I have ever come across.  The coverage is amazing and it adds such depth and character to your project (mine is a fence).  I first painted the fence white with Barn and Fence paint because my choices were either red or white.  The white fence was IMPOSSIBLE to maintain so I went on a search.  I found treasure in this paint and always have it on hand. (We have a little \"garden structure\" affection.  You can see in the first photo when I went from white to Stormcoat.  The fence took on a whole different feel.  Everyone loves it.  Don't waste your money on expensive designer paint.  This is what you are looking for. We spend just about every Friday night at Lowes with our doggie, dreaming and planning.  Don't stop doing what you do. Enjoy.",

If the weather would just cooperate I think a few more days will do it. We also purchased a graco airless sprayer. The teal covered in one coat and looks great, the white however is taking 3 coats, but bear in mind we are covering dark brown. As for the 15 year warranty , only time will tell! The X5 Graco is wonderful! Would give it 5 stars all day long! I have a photo to add, but the color doesn't photograph true to color!",

All I needed was an inexpensive paint that would cover completely and dry quickly and this did the trick. One of my renters had painted the house, which was built in 1991, in lieu of some rent a few years back. When I started in on a detailed inspection I found several areas of trim that he had missed. Therefore sections weren't painted in 22 years! One coat did the trick and it looks great. I used the same type of paint tinted for the rest of the house and it is the best looking property on the street now according to the realtor.Highly recommend this product!",

This will be a favorite for me and first choice for use on my personal house. I used it to paint the board behind my new gutters and will use it on other parts of my house as well. The price is less than $20 a gallon (no more $40 paint for me!) and the quality is extremely good. Time will tell the full story. I am impressed with the thickness of the paint. Another plus is that it can be applied when temperatures get down to the high 30's.",

Paint is made to dry slow enough to let paint brush strokes flow and level out, while drying fast enough to to become resistant to floating and blowing dust, dirt, debris and curious fingertips. Paying attention to the temperature, humidity, wind and amount of direct sunlight. The temperature will speed the drying time as will direct sunlight as they increase. The dry time will slow as humidity rises and any wind will amplify the effects of humidity.If painting a door or in direct sunlight , you would want to reduce with Floetrol or water, to extend the dry time and allow for brush strokes to disappear.If painting exterior trim, use at full strength and be protected faster from bugs or rain.",

It seems that Lowes employees go by a formula for adding tint and put a little splotch of paint on the lid near the label but don't put it on your paint chip(which never matches.

I used semi-gloss StormCoat and was very happy with the results.  Sealed very well and looks great a year later.  I did need 3-4 coats in the most damaged areas.  Each new coat goes on easier and takes less paint.  Anyone having problems probably did not do good surface prep.  Painting a house is like painting a car, good surface cleaning and prep is crucial.  I pressures washed first and then scraped all weak areas.  Then I used a mold killing primer in the bad areas.  Then I rolled/brushed it on.  I do not recommend spraying a house.

So we went to a hardware store 10 miles away that carried Valspar paint. We were disappointed to find that while carrying Valspar paint, they didn't have the Stormcoat that we wanted. Still not wanting to travel farther, we opted for Kilz2 Latex Multi-surface Stainblocker. This product gave better coverage than the Valspar Stormcoat. We have always liked Valspar paint and have used for several household projects. However, if we hadn't needed to replenish our supply as we did, we would have never realized that we could have chosen a better product to begin with.",

Low temperatures and high humidity slow the dry time, which allows for trash to be blown into the wet paint or runs and sags can develop. If the paint dries too fast you will end up with bush and roller marks and a difficult clean up of tools. Take control of your dry time by reducing the paint with Floetrol additive or water. You can make the paint fast dry or slow dry with no effect on color or quality.",

The shelves were older wood, and had never been painted. It took 2 coats to cover most of the wood, and in some cases, 3 coats, especially where there were knots in the wood. Maybe I should have used some other paint for the wood, but it did a great job for the block.",

Paint manufactures, even Valspar, has to pass inspections and tests before they can sell the paint. Valspar sold paint in the northern states for years before they expanded to the southern states because of the expense of the mildew resistant formula. When their product was approved for Lowe's home improvement, the increased sales made it worth while. All paint bought in the south is mildew resistant. The chemical has a short life span, therefore you will be forced to pressure wash at some point, depending on your weather conditions. Shady areas where the sun cannot reach will mildew faster. After a rain, the wood on your house has to have air and sun, if trees are too close then mildew will begin to grow.",
