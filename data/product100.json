I was about to paint my stairs and one of the pins in the locking mechanism broke.  I looked on their website for the warranty and the only thing they said was \"we don't have one but we stand behind our ladders\".  Must be way back!!!  So I don't recommend this ladder, I recommend the real one which has a warranty at least.  I added a pick as proof of the damage.  Again, I rarely use this ladder so it's not from wear and tear.",

            "text": "There are trade-offs with any product and that is true for this ladder. The MT-26 provides a very stable 13 foot step ladder but it also is very heavy and the steps are less than half as wide as those of a regular step ladder and so not comfortable for standing on for any amount of time.\n\nThe rungs are also too far apart to use something like the Werner AC24 tray so I need to tie a bucket to the ladder for parts I need when at the top.\n\nVery easy to adjust the height on each side and not have to support the entire weight of the ladder. I have similar ladders and they are not nearly as easy to adjust even though they are much shorter ladders.\n\nAs this is a very heavy ladder I would recommend buying only as tall a MT ladder as you actually will need.",

The MT 26 is somewhat heavy but not extraordinarily so, as it is rated as a Type1A, 300 lb test weight. It's a large ladder & large ladders can be heavy. I've never had to ask for help using it in whatever configuration is needed. It's very versatile with multiple combinations of\nladder configurations. I use the MT 26 mainly for painting walls where steps/stairs are present. It collapses \nto a length that can easily be carried in a small pickup \nw/o a rack if need be. \n\nDefinitely NOT a homeowner ladder imo(the MT 17, MT22 would be better suited for homeowners).\n\nIn 17 years of constant use I've never had any issues with the latches. \n\nBottom Line: Well worth the $ for a quality product engineered to last many years",

For 3 years we couldn't figure out an easy way to hang the pictures and decided to try the MT-26 after reading other reviews.We were very happy with how easy it was to configure for the stairs and how stable the ladder was. It was a lot easier to break the ladder down when we were done for the day. Just had to make sure there wasn't pressure on the hinge points so the locks would operate smoothly.This is a heavy ladder and it took my wife and I to move the ladder on the stair way. My wife doesn't have a lot of upper body strength, but it was very easy for the two of us to move the ladder up and down the stairs. I could have done the set up if the stair way wasn't finished and you weren't too concerned about little nicks and dings in the sheet rock.We should have bought the ladder several years ago.",
