I put back on my Diablo that had done several (a lot - like at least a dozen) jobs and finished the job out over the next couple days with it.  I thought it might be getting a little dull - that is why I bought a new blade.  Well I found out what dull is after 5 measly cuts with this Irwin.  Lowes was good in that they let me return the blade with no hassle.  I guess Irwin does not actually specifically state that the blade is for Hardie like Freud and Dewalt do, but they do say that it is for Fiber cement, and Hardie is fiber cement.  So I don't know what the deal is.",

I saw it in Lowe's bought one then after it burned the teeth when I was 1/3 into the job (destroying several planks in the process which are also $13 each). So  I did a dumbest thing and went back and bought 2 more desperate to finish the job rather than looking for better blad. Only now after I'm looking for blade to cut bricks I saw the reviews and I wish I had spend more money on a better blade from the beginning. I'll take the 3 toothless blades back to Lowe's as someone suggested in one review and hopefully they give me credit towards better blade.",

I am a contractor and just grabbed 2 of these blades today as I finally wore out another brand of blade that I have use extensively.  They were dead in 6 rip cuts each in hardie, I counted.  I was not able to complete my work today as a result which as a business man is less than ideal.  This is hardly the fault of Lowes where I shop almost daily. However Lowes does not need to leave this product on their shelves and there are many other choices available at this price point to fill the lowes shelves.  Some of us literally depend on lowes to provide quality products by which we run our businesses.  I would like to propose the following, contact Irwin and have them provide an RMA for this product and compensate lowes for damage to your brand. While your on the phone to Irwin I would ask the engineering manager for a copy of their test results when this product was developed.  If they are looking for a place to test there product they are welcome to join me for a month, send them my contact information if you like.  We can go out together and try to make a living using this product.  I am willing to bet once their kids start to get hungry their testing will improve.  Better yet Lowes can send them a stick of hardie for Irwin to actually make 6 cuts with, that will be a great start to their new and improved testing.",
