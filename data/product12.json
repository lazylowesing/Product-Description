Over the last couple of years I've purchased two huge truckloads of rubber mulch from Lowe's (delivered in a tractor-trailer from out of state). Not only looks great, but keeps weeds and insects out and doesn't wash away, as well as providing somewhat of a \"greenhouse\" effect of keeping the soil from drying out. I recently needed a couple of extra bags, which I was able to buy in Lowe's garden shop, rather than order a truckload (which comes in many individual 40 lb. bags). I have learned that to do it right you MUST put it down in a two or three inch depth. My young Japanese gardens are thriving and growing beautifully.",

The flower beds get full sunlight most of the day, and all of the plants look really vibrant against the black background. There is no \"gray or brown\" in this mulch. It's not as heavy as regular mulch, which was surprising, and it has a sort of \"chunky\" look to it when it is spread. All in all, for the short amount of time I've had mine, I'm very pleased with the look. As far as cost, it was more expensive than regular mulch, but if it continues to hold up and look as clean as it does so far, I have no problem with the price.",

It spread quickly and easily, looks like wood and I won't have to worry with replacing it every year.Although the cost per bag is considerably more than wood mulch, when you factor in that you are not replacing it every year due to discoloring or deterioration, it is a great value.

There is a slight rubber smell when you first apply it, which is to be expected. Keep in mind this is an investment product. Don't go by Lowes' specifications for a coverage guideline. We went with that and bought 30 bags and ended up having to buy 50 more to finish the area shown in the picture I'm attaching. The area covered in this photo is 30 bags of mulch covering landscapes fabric. I would suggest using the guidelines on the back and doubling it - particularly if you're laying over landscape fabric. Nonetheless, this truly is a GREAT product! My yard looks great year around, there are no fly away pieces like you see with wood mulch, and I don't need to reapply every year!",

The mulch is very light weight which made for a very fast and easy install. I really like the idea of not having to replace the mulch every year and the idea of being maintenance free. Upon install, I noticed a few pieces of the rope of the tire, even found a piece of steel. After laying 13 bags, I picked out about a handful of trash. Not a ton, but still worth noting. I did not notice a smell as other reviews have mentioned. I purchased the brown mulch and to me it almost looks black. It is a little darker then I would have liked, but it does provide a nice contrast. Lastly, a few bags had a white residue on them, it seemed to wipe off so I'm hopefully that it will clean off with the first rain. Overall I would purchase the mulch again, I just wish it was a little cheaper.",

It has a ever so slight rubber smell, but mostly disapates after a day or so. The cost was the only issue, but now I know I'm done mulching for years. I don't have to mess with the front of the house again! Looks so good : )",

I wanted this product, but it was out of stock. I was lucky, they just received a delivery, one pallet, so I bought 10 bags. Not cheap at 9.99 a bag, but much better than the Vigoro product. This stuff is excellent. I should have bought more bags, I looked on line later the same day  and the entire pallet is gone. I replaced wood mulch, which breeds ants, and also fades after a short time. The wood turns rotten white etc. Never again. This stuff should last many years. Go buy it.",

The color has held well with no bleeding which is important since it was used for walking paths for our dogs. I haven't noticed any metal artifacts which seems to be a problem with cheaper products. The one negative is the cost. It's substantially higher than nugget-size products which is an issue if buying in bulk. Considering you are getting .80 cubic feet expect a major financial investment. Long-term it's a savings from decomposable products which have to be renewed annually.",

I plan on it being the last mulch I lay down in my lifetime ( I foresee myself not caring that much about mulch past a certain age). Every year, the dreaded chore of mulching comes to visit and I just got sick of it. This stuff looks real, keeps the weeds down and retains its color. It's lightweight too so no more hauling out the wheelbarrow to transport multiple bags. The only tough pill to swallow is the price, almost $10/bag. That's pricey but it's worth it to me in the end to only do it once.",

My beautiful crocus are not able to push up through it! The mulch is in large chunks now. I have 100's of crocus. I'm going to need to remove all of the mulch to replace with wood mulch. I like the rubber mulch for color retention and stability.  It does not give any nutrients by breaking down. So now my opinion now that I used to have used both-Rubber  and Wood. They both have their benefits for certain types of gardens. On my hillside where I don't want the wind to blow the mulch off will be perfect for rubber mulch.",

I like that the bags are much lighter to lift and move around. I'm not getting any younger. It saves me a lot of grief and back pain to use this type of mulch instead of the the wood mulch. I love to garden and the more I can do by myself, the happier I am. The cost is high, but what isn't these days. It's still cheaper all the way around though. Less time spent going to the store every year to break your back remulching the yard. I think it retains the ground moisture better than wood mulch too. My plants love this stuff!!!

Only time will tell if I get my money worth out of it but if I do it was a great investment. The coverage is great. I will need to get a few more bags to cover the areas that I put on a little thin. I was running out of bags and wanted to prohibit any weed growth before I make another trip to the store. The bag gives you a coverage guide but I didn't know the measurements of the bed. I suggest knowing this information before buying to prevent return trips to finish your project.",

I tore out marble color terrace stone and have put in Arkansas creek rock as borders and walls. The mulch accents it perfectly.

Mine will look great year after year.If you have the money for the initial outlay, you can't go wrong to buy it. I don't smell the rubber unless I spray water on it on one of these 100 degree days we have been having for the last month.

This year, residents opted for black mulch which looks so sharp against the lush greens.  Any landscaping the owners do is their responsibility; and, getting on in years, we decided to purchase the shredded black rubber mulch.  We are hoping it will last for many years and retain its black color.  Reading some previous reviews, I hoped we didn't find too many large pieces.  We put down 10 bags and only found a few larger pieces...the rest of nicely shredded.  It was easy to apply.  Would recommend it to anyone considering rubber mulch.",

So far it has looked great and can't even tell that it is rubber.  It seems to stay in place fairly well and as time goes on I expect it to lock in even more.  You will get a few pieces in each bag that aren't shredded but just put them at the bottom and cover them up.  The smell of rubber will dissipate after a few weeks at most but I enjoy the smell so it does not bother me. Seems like a great investment so far and I have no regrets.

Some times I spread a thin layer over the old to refresh the color. Finally I noticed that when I used real wood mulch the real mulch got termites and disintegrated turning to dirt fast.

Spend hours removing old pine straw and replacing with new only for it to look faded within months. Leaves and such get trapped in pine straw so you cant really preserve the cleanliness of your work. In comes rubberific. We bought 10 bags initially to try in a small bed around an arbor. Installation was a breeze. Light bags, easy spreadability and very, very little debris to pick out. We found a few paper label barcodes and that was it. It is shredded so it looks just like wood mulch. So far two people have had no clue it's rubber.Now on to the reason this brand is worth the extra money spent. 1) they only use industrial tires which means there is no metal and no string. Think about it... Other brands have string. How is a piece of fabric going to retain its color while baking in the sun or being washed in the rain for years? My thought is it doesn't. 2) it's appearance is super realistic. All the pieces lay flat and settle just like wood mulch. Other brands aren't shredded as well, or are nuggets. No thank you. 3) the non toxic guarantee.",

Smells like rubber for maybe the first week and then that's it. It's amazing how real it looks even when you hold it in you hand. I ordered over 100 bags and am hoping to not have to mulch for a decade. Some things I learned: 1) There are different dye lots. Don't assume dark brown is dark brown. I bought the remainder of the pallet at our local store and when I went back the next pallet definitely had more a a reddish tinge to it. When you're spreading in the shade you can't tell, but then the sun comes out and it looked like two slightly different products. I was not happy about that. Just beware. I put landscape fabric down and it spreads much better and evenly. After 2 months the furry woodland creatures around the house have dug into it a few times. 1\" is minimally sufficient, but I have found you need to buy extra to go back and cover exposed sites once it settles in. I would plan on buying 2-5 extra bags depending on your job. It did wash away around some downspouts, but it doesn't float away like you might think. Bags are light and easy to carry around. Stop waiting. Bite the bullet on the price and buy it! Great product and MUCH better than any other rubber mulch product on the market. I've looked at them ALL!!",

Maybe the smallest hint of red in the sunlight. It spreads super easily and doesn't have any awkward looking big chunks. You have to pick it up, look closely and bend it before you realize it's rubber and not natural. Exactly the look I was going for. It's going to be expensive to replace multiple cubic yards worth, but I'm thinking about the long term savings. I also love that I won't have to be trucking it across my yard every spring.

I will actually need a couple of the huge palettes, but decided to try one bag first. I was not disappointed! Dark brown color looks just like the tinted natural mulch I have bought in past years. Maybe the smallest hint of red in the sunlight. It spreads super easily and doesn't have any awkward looking big chunks. You have to pick it up, look closely and bend it before you realize it's rubber and not natural. Exactly the look I was going for. It's going to be expensive to replace multiple cubic yards worth, but I'm thinking about the long term savings. I also love that I won't have to be trucking it across my yard every spring. Wish it was less expensive, but still a great product!",

I don't think I'd be good with stone because I don't like using herbicides and I think grass and weeds would grow up through it (I don't really know --haven't tried it).

So, I spent the big $ and used the brown rubber mulch. Underneath the rubber mulch, I had the guy first lay down the landscape cloth and put the mulch on top of it. I don't put the mulch where plants are (like inside the raised beds). It is perfect! Once a year, I may buy a couple of bags to patch up where leaf blowing may have dispersed some of the mulch outside the garden area.

Needless to say, we were shocked at the slivers of mulch that poured out of the bag.  Two bags of it hardly covered a fraction on the space that rubber nuggets cover.  We drove to a Lowe's in a city 30 miles away to get the nugget variety.  Our two local Lowe's do not carry the nuggets that we have used for many years.  I couldn't believe that neither of them stocked this amazing product.  Nugget mulch is the best thing since slice bread!  Well anyway, I do not recommend the shredded rubber mulch. Too expensive (almost $10 a bag), doesn't cover much area, and too lightweight.  It would have blown away had we not covered it with the nugget mulch.  The only thing that this could be used for best would be in planters.",

One time it was less than a month that the wood mulch faded. The following year adding yet more mulch to cover for the color fade and freshen it up and then typically within 2-3 years we would have to dig the beds up as they were too full of faded mulch. Factoring in the cost to do, redo, and dig it up and yet redo again we realize that it was costing us a lot for mulch and the loss of time. Not to mention there are disclaimers not to use wood mulch against building since oòinsects are attracted to the wood. No more red hands, no more color fade and no more bug worries. Sure it cost a pretty penny to lanscape the entire yard in rubber mulch but at 43 the last thing I want to be doing is mulching every Spring or getting raked over the coals by a landscaper here in nj.",

I would recommend this to anyone; not only for looks, but for economical reasons. The initial cost is higher, but, you will be replacing your mulch far less often.",

The brown color and the shred size varies greatly from one batch to another batch. I purchased 45 bags of this brown rubber mulch from the same Lowe's store, but during several trips. The first 40 bags are a much larger shred size and an orange brown color. The last 5 bags are a very fine shred and more of a black brown color. I've traveled to 4 different Lowe's stores to try to find more that matches the 40 bags that are already in my flower beds, with no luck. Contact Customer Service at the manufacturer, sent pictures to them and now I have to send them samples to prove that the bags of mulch don't match. Spent $340.00 and now I cannot locate any matching mulch. Tried to post pictures, but this site would not post the pictures.",

I have seen a decrease in insect activity, as this does not attract bugs.  Not having to buy mulch every season makes this well worth the additional cost!  I highly recommend it.   One precaution, do not step on it barefoot in the middle of the summer, it is very hot. Ha ha",

            "text": "I was dreading putting mulch down AGAIN (regular mulch lasts 1 year, 2 years is pushing it), and found this stuff. It really looks like real mulch and went down really easy. bags smaller and lighter than regular mulch. The cost is about 3x regular mulch, but if it lasts 12 years as advertised I am ahead of the game. It is made from recycled tires, I didn't find any wire or junk in my bags. I bought 15 bags. I liked that it will thwart insects as this I put it several feet from a part cedar/part brick house. There is a slight rubbery smell,  for the first week or so but goes away, although you don't smell rubber when you initially put it down. It's been a month and it still looks great. Actually looks better than the bags of regular mulch (I have found sometimes the regular dark brown mulch has 5 to 10% white spots on it). It was about $9.99 a bag. I'm liking it so far, especially since it looks better and was easier to apply. I got the dark brown color. Hopefully, my nephew in 2nd grade will be close to graduating high school until I have to redo this.",

Not having dogs, I don't know if they would \"go\" in it, or continue to use the yard area, but if they did go in the mulch it would be quite a problem to clean up. We put it down over old style mulch, without using plastic or anything under it and did not have weed problems.",
