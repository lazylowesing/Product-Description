So we purchased a 12\" unfinished base cabinet to fit next to the dishwasher to fill in the leftover space.  This cabinet was perfect, we'll paint this one white to match the other cabinets.  The drawer is a little higher (about 1/8\") on one end but not too worried about it.  I noticed, though, that the cabinet does NOT contain a shelf (and no pre-drilled holes) as noted in the specifications of this cabinet.  I called Lowe's and they said that 12\" cabinets do not contain a shelf. So I guess the renters will make do!  I would recommend if a shelf is not needed.....",

I won't know until I can stain & finish everything. There are some hardware pieces that could use an ungrade (ie, plastic on the corner joints and drawer runners). The face frame is gorgeous.

I painted them and they looked good. 2 months ago, I purchased another set for another property and have been very disappointed. The material they are made of is very cheap. I had my painter to sand them muliple times to get a decent smooth finish. Then after painting, the drawers would not slide properly. I even paid a cabinet maker to work on them while he was installing the countertop. He made them better, however, they still do not work properly. I contacted Lowes by email stating the problem. That has been 3 weeks now with no answer. I called the store and was instructed to leave my number and someone would call me. That has been 2 weeks with no response.

We ordered online and picked up in store. Neither one of us noticed there was a cabinet front missing until we got home and unloaded because there's cardboard stapled to the top and bottom to prevent drawers from sliding and doors from opening during transit. Called the store and was able to get it replaced no problem. But then on a second cabinet, after being stained, the drawer was bumped and the top kind of popped off. Tried to screw it back in and it won't stay put. Will probably have to use glue.I used an outdoor semi transparent deck stain. It was mostly due to the color, but it's also mold resistant so that's a plus. Used one coat of stain and 3 coats of poly. I did have to sand them, but I expected to have to do that to begin with. The hinges are adjustable so for that earlier review of there being a gap in the doors... Easily fixable with adjusting (directions tell you how to)Overall I'm excited about my new kitchen cabinets. Will be buying more for my coffee bar and liquor bar in the dining room.",

The oak face frame,doors, and drawer front look identical to the old cabinets. \n\nThe old cabinets had 1/2\" particle board for the cabinet body and have held up fairly well over the years. The new cabinet has 3/8\" particle board and it is extremely brittle. I rented the Lowes truck to cart the new cabinet home. When I got home a 2\" x 4\" hole had been punched in the back that was not there when I bought the cabinet.\n\nI had to cover one of the sides with 1/8\" oak plywood because it was on an exposed end. I used a brad nailer to shoot small pins to hold the plywood to the cabinet along with some glue. The particle board on inside of the cabinet had cratered where ever the pin had entered.",

            "text": "I'm remodeling a home as a rental and chose to go with these \"unfinished\" cabinets to save time. Unfinished is right. I'll start at the beginning.First, check your cabinets over very carefully, especially if you are having them delivered. These are built very cheaply, and damage is common. One of my uppers had a hole punched through the back. They were delivered, so I don't know if it happened during delivery or if it was already damaged when loaded into the truck. Lowes exchanged it without a problem. I had to take it back to the store, but that isn't really a hassle since I'm there pretty often anyway.The cabinets themselves are fairly flimsy. I understand that you get what you pay for, but even the particle board used to build them is the cheapest quality. The base cabinets I received have plastic corner braces in the top, with a screw hole for attaching the counter top. This would be a nice feature, if the braces weren't merely stapled to the cabinet. And, I mean stapled with a regular T-50 staple, just one staple on each side mind you. Most of the braces in my base cabinets popped loose just from moving the cabinets around. The drawer slides are attached in a similar flimsy fashion, and will not last long, so be ready to correct that problem too.Next, when you go to \"finish\" the cabinets, you have a bit of work to do. These cabinets ARE NOT ready for stain. If you're painting them, you might be OK. If you plan to stain them, as I did, get ready for a lot of sanding. The manufacturer apparently only has one grit in their drum sander. From the looks of the heavy scratches in the face frames and doors, I would say it's probably 20 or 40 grit. Every single cabinet I bought has the same sanding marks on the stiles and horizontal door frames. They must build the face frames and door frames then run them through the drum sander with that heavy grit, and don't bother to clean them up. I spent hours sanding with my random orbit sander to try to get rid of those deep scratches. Here's one last note on finishing: Watch out for the glue the manufacturer uses to assemble. They aren't real careful about where it ends up.Once you finally get them stained (or painted), you will find another problem. When you go to hang them, there are NO screw blocks installed. I guess they expect you to just drive screws through that cheap particle board back, which will not hold up for long. I glued 3/4\" x 3/4\" strips to the top and bottom of the uppers so I had something solid to screw through, without punching through the back.Something else you won't notice in the store (because it's covered by the cardboard label) is the huge gap between the doors on the larger two-door cabinets. A little gap is fine, but nearly 1/2\"? Really? The doors didn't come with bumpers either, so I had to buy those.Finally, you have to buy the toe kick and end panels separately. The end panels I can somewhat understand. The interior cabinets don't really need them, since it will never be seen, but no toe kick? That is a part that will always be visible. Lowes is happy to sell you end panels and toe kicks, but if you have a table saw, or are good with a circular saw, you are better off buying a sheet of 1/4\" oak plywood and making your own. I have a table saw and for a $30 sheet of plywood, I was able to make my own end panels and kicks, which saved me about $80.I have a well equipped wood shop and maybe it's just the wood worker in me, but these cabinets are of the poorest quality I have ever seen. You get what you pay for, but these are still over priced for what you get. I simply didn't have time to build cabinets, and didn't want to spend a lot for cabinets in a rental, but I'll make time if I ever do this again.The cabinets are installed, and after a lot of prep work they look OK. I have my doubts as to how long they will last though.",

There is literally no support for the base shelf which is merely a piece of Luan glued to the sides. Over more than a few pounds will likely make it collapse. In order to use it for a workshop cabinet the underside needs to be reinforced and 1/2 inch thick piece of plywood placed over the base Shelf. The drawer is equally light-duty. It is perhaps made for plastic kitchen utensils. It too must be reinforced if it is going to carry boxes of nails, screwdrivers Etc.",

The cabinet frame is cheap particle board with a faux wood coating on the inside.  If these are end cabinets, you have to buy an end piece to cover up the particle board so it will look like it is solid wood.  I purchased one 3-drawer base cabinet last year to replace one quickly that fell apart in our kitchen.  It worked out well so I purchased 7 more.  I sanded and stained them and they look beautiful.  They are functional and I'm happy.  If you are willing to put a little effort into these then it is worth it for the cost savings.  If not, the go pay $4-500 for a cabinet this size.  I spent $500 for 7 cabinets (different sizes).",

            "text": "Annoying.... I have been buying unfinished oak cabinets for the past 10 years. They've really plummeted in quality in the past 5, and now are harder and harder to find in stock at stores. I usually go to the \"other\" big box place for these, but they no longer stock them. I feel like a sucker for buying these cabinets from Lowes. First - the sides are now made out of much thinner particle board, and I'll have to attach some 1\" x 3\" to the inside upper edge of the base cabinets so they can actually support my table top/basic countertop. There are huge gaps where the hinges attach to the doors, and some doors don't close flush. Also - no shelves inside is idiotic. So now I have to fashion my own for this cabinet, which won't match, and there isn't even any way to attach them (ie. pre-drilled holes for shelf pegs. How chintzy. Lastly, the base cabinets are randomly 1\" taller than usual... if you measure the front face from top to bottom, it's 31\". Usually this measurement is 30\".... this kind of screws me over because I am making a desk out of these cabinets and plan to remove the toekick. My desk is going to sit 3/4\" higher than planned (30\" is already higher than usual desk height) -- but also, in certain areas I was going to use a wall cabinet on the ground as a base cabinet. Usually you can line up a 30\" high wall cabinet with the door/drawer face of a base cabinet. But now - it's off due to this random higher height. The standard height for base cabinets has always been 34-1/2\". This arbitrary change is annoying. Sad that multiple places could ruin such a simple product... and it's not \"you get what you pay for\" because the pre-finished (laminate) cabinets are about the same quality, the flaws are just hidden by the laminate, yet you pay much more! If I knew this decline was going to happen I would have finished all my projects reliant on unfinished cabinets 5 years ago. They may be \"out of fashion\" but there is something very utilitarian and flexible about these cabinets that makes them classic. Not everyone wants plastic covered cabinets. Just because these are unfinished and ready to go doesn't mean they need to be made like garbage.",
