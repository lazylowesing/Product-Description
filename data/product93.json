The sticker has a very aggressive adhesive that was difficult to remove. I had to use a hair drier to heat it up to remove it. It still left a light mark. Alcohol and window cleaner helped, but you can still see where the sticker was. Why use such an aggressive label? And why put it on the slate top? Should have been placed on the plastic wrapper. I'm deducting a star for that.",
