Husqvarna typically seems to be a solid brand but after 1 cut of our backyard the mower started running really rough and shaking. White smoke started pouring out of the engine and it then shut down. It's really hot and there's oil all over the body of the mower making me think the gas and oil is mixing or there's a seal issue somewhere. We used top of the line gas and the oil provided. Since we had it less than 2 weeks I though I could take it back to Lowes but they wouldn't take it. I emailed Husqvarna and was told we need to take it into a certified engine repair shop. Uggg! I just want my boys to be able to cut the grass without the mower overheating and dying.",

It also acts like a vacuum cleaner it will grab EVERYTHING and put it in the bag.   In just 1/3 of my yard it picked up more stuff than my troy did mowing the whole thing 4 times.  Also you can actually tell when the bag is full it will keep jamming stuff in there until you need a crowbar to get the clippings out.  My yard is looking fantastic.  Can't wait for fall when I try it on the pine needle half of my yard.  I shouldn't have to rake that part this year :)  Did take some time to get used to the free wheel mode as your going when you let off the drive bar push forward another inch and you'll be able to pull it backwards freely.  Also put a zip tie on the drive bar and lift it up to the point where it would start engaging that way you don't have to reach as far to pull it up.  Also it's a bit fast running around a tree so let off on the bar a bit.  You can see in the photo where I ran behind it at full speed and the turf it threw up.",

I was assured by lowes staff this was a good mower for my yard (just over 1/4 acre) but its exactly the opposite. It constantly shuts down and gets clogged, mind you I've used this thing twice. I'm truly appalled by the performance, or lack thereof. To say this thing can mulch is a crime, it certainly does not which is why it constantly gets clogged up. Also, it has EXTREMELY poor design which I didn't notice when I was purchasing it. Directly under the blades all the belts are completely exposed, as you can imagine grass and debris fly up into the belts and mower, causing it to clog, how they would launch a product with design flaws like this is beyond comprehension. If you have a lawn the size of a postage stamp and cut your grass every 3 days this mower may work for you, but if you cut your grass every weekend like most human beings avoid this mower like the plague. Major disappointment. Was also told by Lowe's I would have 30 days to return this product if I chose but by reading other reviews thay doesn't seem to be the case. I will still be attempting to return this, if I'm unable to I'll be taking my business to home depot in the future due to the misleading information I was given by lowes staff. Dont buy this mower, spend the extra money and get yourself a Honda, my neighbor has one and it works phenomenally! If I could give -5 stars I would.",

I was very surprised that I only had to pull the starting string (which required very little effort) a couple of times before it started.

The mower is also light enough to maneuver in tight spots.  The bagging capacity is quite adequate and doesn't clog easily. the design allow for maximum bag filling before need to empty.What kept me from giving this a 5, is the shoot design for bagging. While it bags nicely, I noticed a hole in the bag after a few uses.  The plastic guard rubs the bag in such a way that friction is tearing it.

The Briggs and Stratton engine on this mower is simply fabulous didn't even hesitate in the deepest area of my grass and it is very thick new sod  Now for the not so good... by staying rear discharge they should clarify that no matter what you do it is going to discharge grass out the rear of the mower the entire time while you mow bag on or not!  They were very correct by placing stickers all over the mower stating that it is a fire hazardbecause massive amounts of grass pile up on top of the extremely hot engine non-stop while you mow. Very happy with Briggs and Stratton engine but the extremely poor door/bag design really deserves a 0! There is no way Husqvarna is doing any quality control at all because this product never should have left the factory. This ones going back and Husqvarna has lost my business.",

This would happen about 7 times while cutting a small lawn with grass that wasn't that high. I had to stop and clean out with a putty knife each time this happened.  I returned it to Lowe's after two weeks and got a Honda mower.  It is a completely different experience!  No clogs or stalling.",

Gas and oil levels were fine.  It would simply start up and then die a few seconds later.  I took it to a repair guy who said the carburetor and air filter needed cleaning.  He did this and it worked fine after the next mow.  However the second time after the repair the same problems developed as before.  There is obviously something more seriously wrong than an air filter and dirty carburetor.  This is totally unacceptable for a mower that retails for this kind of money.  I have never had a mower do this kind of thing after dozens of uses, let alone five.  I'll never buy a Husqvarna product again.",

The AWD feature was one main reason I bought this machine as I have a hilly terrain.  I heard that Husqvarna was a good brand so I bought this with the help from other reviews on this.

You got me on your convenient little loophole, Husqvarna. Never again. And the newest issue is the blade locks up after it heats up. Can't even pull the rope.

After reading reviews and tons of articles, I decided to settle on this one.  I have a .87 acre lot.  So probably just over a true .50 acre to mow.   I was concerned about going from a riding to a push mower.  But I was wrong.  This little mower has been really enjoyable.  Its easy to set up.  Its also got decent power.   My yard is sloped and I didn't know how the AWD would do on it.   It literally pulls me up the hills with no problems at all. I am amazed that it starts with one pull each time.  This may be common now, but my experience with push mowers was yanking a ton before it stated.  It does fairly good on tall grass (4-5in.).   You can here that the engine struggles a bit but the results are a nice clean cut.   If you are going to be mowing extremely high grass you may want to look for a mower with a larger engine.  But for the majority of owners this mower should do the job very well.  I'm sold on the AWD and impressed with the initial quality of this mower. It had much more metal that the Troy Built's seem to have.  The handle attachment and height adjustments are all metal.  I haven't bagged all that much yet so I can't speak to that aspect.  But the mulching capabilities exceeded my expectations.  Overall I'm very impressed with the initial quality and performance of this mower.",

The gas filler hole is big and easy to use. One thing to note is the wheel height adjustment. The directions say to increase cutting height, move the wheel levers (as in all the levers) towards the center of the mower. In reality this applies only to the front levers. To raise the height you need to move the rear levers away from the center of the mower (i.e., same direction as the front ones).",

I've got about and acre of land and some thick grass. If my grass gets even the slightest to high it wraps its self around the drive shafts. Once there is too much grass wrapped around them the AWD stops working, and its impossible to push this mower without the awd. Also, I am constantly fixing the belt that runs everything. It seems like I'm constantly fixing one or the other. Lastly trying to bag your lawn clippings with this mower is impossible. My lawn clippings just get caught in the hole of the mower and never make it to the bag. Honestly the only plus side to this mower is the low maintenance engine.

            "text": "I waited to write this review since I used reviews before purchasing this machine and found them very helpful.  So I will return the favor and hope that it helps you.   I bought mine two mowing seasons ago and about to start the third.  I felt like I needed to go through at least one year before putting out my review, so here it is.  This machine is a fantastic purchase for push mowers.  My yard isn't big enough for a rider but I couldn't keep pushing any more so I looked at the all wheel drive ones that were out there.  After reviews I pulled the trigger on this one.  Very glad I did.  First, the set up is fairly easy once out of the box.  Do what you need to do with the oil and start up instructions and you won't have any problems.  Starts on the first pull every time! When I first looked at it, it was advertised with a Honda motor but when I purchased it, it came with a Briggs and Straton one, which bothered me at first but after 2 years it is still going strong with absolutely no issues.  Just do the preventative maintenance.  Next, the all wheel drive is incredible.  But go easy cause at first the speed goes rather quickly and it will go.  Good power for the drive. Takes a little bit of getting used to if you haven't owned one of these before.  The corners and the back ups take a little getting used to.The bagging part is good but the placement of the hookup and removing it under the push bars gets a little tiresome but you can get used to it.  A TIP: Don't bag every time. I change the height of my mowing.  Mow once lower and bag, then on the next mow, cut it a little higher and mulch.  It not only helps the lawn but it helps your back too! One nice surprise is the amount of gas it uses. It doesn't use very much.  It is very fuel efficient.  I purchase about 2 gals of gas for this puppy and it lasts me the whole spring and summer mowing season.  I used to buy 4 gals with my old Walmart mower.  So there's that.  Cleaning it is easy.  Mine came with the hose attachment for cleaning underneath but it's hard to see.  I just finish mowing and take the hose to it on top and then I lean the mower back to see the underneath and wash that off.  Warning: Do this in the backyard or in an inconspicuous area because the left over cut grass will get messy. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this mower.  Gotta say that I now expect this machine to last me a few more years without many issues so long as it gets taken care of.  Like anything else, if you keep up with the low maintenance on it, it shouldn't be a problem for you either.   Thanks Husqvarna for a quality product and Thanks Lowe's for stocking and supporting them!",

It started right up, cut pretty well (even though it was a little light on power), and the self-propelled system worked great.  By the fourth cut, it was stalling out often, and finally cut out and would not start back up.  Same gas, from same gas can I had used to fill it up before.  Not worth me diagnosing the problem (oil in the filter, etc) because having a mover that stopped working in less than 30 days and 4 cuts was not worth the headaches.  I bought the mower because my Dad's small engine equipment from this brand worked forever (chainsaws, weed whackers, etc).  Whether I got a bad mower from a good company or the company has gone downhill, I can not say.  Will be hesitant to buy products made by this company again.  To Lowe's credit, they took the mower back with no hassle.",

            "text": "First one purchased had to be returned and replaced because the AWD stopped working after the first 15 minutes. IT WAS BRAND NEW! Vendor gave me another brand new one no questions asked. That 2nd device worked for the rest of the fall season. Come Spring, the AWD failed after the first use. UGH. Had to take it to authorized repair to get fixed. After 3 weeks in repair shop (!) repairing the belt drives, it's cut and driven just fine. Fingers crossed. I would also say it drives too fast. Not much speed control. Either I'm running after it, or have to push it. Not much in-between. It needs a variable speed. Needless to say, I'm not impressed much by the AWD.",

It works great on an embankment I can't take my zero turn on, a little underpowered, but I probably should have bought the more powerful unit, my mistake.Now the bad. The 4WD system failed within the first 2 weeks. While it was covered under warranty, having the warranty people make no sense after a couple of phone calls, I went ahead and just ordered a new front drive unit online. Installation wasn't bad, but necessitated pretty much dismantling the mower. One that was fixed, a week later the bearings that the drive belt runs on, seized. Once again, dealing with Lowes on a warranty was problematic, but, having an engineering background,and after careful inspection, I realized that the bearings are basically push fit into the pulleys. I sourced some better quality dual sealed bearings and installed them myself. Since then, it's been pretty much trouble free. Probably a great mower for people who don't have rapid growing grass, I'll more than replace this one in another year.",

            "text": "First lets go with the pros of this, Very easy to assemble pull it out of box lift handles put them in place and scree in place put the pull cord in holder. Put wheels at level you want. Gas and oil in and you are ready to go. You are not pushing it when AWD works. Starts up really easy prime the engine and pull the cord and it starts up in a pull or two. Now lets go to the cons. You have to push forward to disengage the AWD if you don't wheels do not turn and drag. Does not have side discharge have to pay more money to get that. Drive belt is open underneath and everything gets into so it stops it and slows it down if you want to use it for the mulching part and not using the bag. Grass can't be high if you want to use it for mulching if it is it bogs it down and shuts the AWD down. Can't really set a speed on this one like the others to me this one is all of nothing because if you let it out it acts like it does not want to run. Gas Cap does not want to sit correctly sometimes and if you push it under bushes it turns and leaks gas. (I do like that they have the the gas cap sorta locked into the gas can so it does not fall off when it comes loose) I have had my mower for just over a year actually one year 2 months. the AWD has gone out on it twice first time while under the manufacture warranty the second time was under Lowes 4 year warranty and was told that (I have to clean the wheels out because of debris that it was general maintenance and was not under my Lowes 4 year warranty.) I am not happy with my lowes at all even though they compensated me. I feel like i have wasted my money on a 4 year warranty and i am not completely happy with my mower. Needs a better design to it (cover the belt up so debris can not get into it damage it like it has for me the last two times)Also i would love to have someone explain to me the general maintenance concept of me having to open the wheels to clean them out so the AWD will work.",

No choking, bulb priming just pull and get ready for an effortless mowing session.  Easy to maneuver and very powerful making for a perfect cut of my St. Augustine grass. Love this thing. Only petty thing I don't like and will be adding is a shut off valve to run all gas out of carb, otherwise a great deal and value for such an impressive mower.

It had oil running off the sides even though the oil was at the right level. It also kept overheating after less than 30 minutes of mowing. Purchasing this mower was a waste of money since I ended up paying others to finish my yard on the multiple occasions the mower malfunctioned.

Easy to put together out of the box, not like my old push mower!!! The one issue is that it has an open area around the belt that allows grass to get up inside where the washing feature won't work. This spring the belt slipped off, due in part to the build up of clippings where I couldn't see. Had it fixed and the belt tightened, all of a 25$ cost so I am happy. The mechanic showed me to spray water up around the belt or blow it out with an air compressor to prevent the problem in the future. Overall I am very happy, just need to take care with cleaning. NOTE: This would probably not be a problem but I am often mowing very long grass with a mixture of wild grasses as well live in the country and the yard was native pasture. This is not likely to be a problem with planted lawns!!!",

            "text": "The following is the review the Husqvarna 21inch AWD lawn mower\n \nUnpacking the mower was uneventful. Following the directions on top of the box, I had the mower unpacked and in the driveway in under 5 minutes. Unfolding the arm and assembling the grass catcher bag was trivial. Adding the supplied oil was easy, although, I was a little surprised it was a generic and not Briggs Stratton brand. The gas tank has a nice capacity and the opening was large to make filling easy without spilling. The time from unpack to operational mower was under 30 minutes.\n \nThe mower started with the first pull. There was a lot of smoke, as was mentioned in the manual, but it quickly burned away. The levers controlling the safety shut off and propulsion were easy to work and ergonomically well situated. \n \nThe performance of the mower in its mulching capacity was impressive. Although the grass that was cut was not extremely long, the grass clippings were smaller than most mowers I have used and disappeared nicely into the lawn. The self-propulsion lacked the speed resolution that I expected and was a more of a binary on/off. This was the “out of the box” condition and the linkage can perhaps be adjusted better for a more flowing speed control. The AWD option made the slight hills insignificant in the traction of the mower wheels. The mover was run for almost two hours on one tank of gas with some gas still remaining in the tank. I stopped the mower about 10 times and every time it was easily restarted with one pull.\n\nOverall, this mower was easy to get operational, felt well built, and did a great job at cutting the grass. I would recommend this mower to someone who has a large area yard with slight hills.",

The mower is extremely loud and vibrated more than anything I've used before. It feels like the blade was never balanced from day 1.  If you need another lawn ornament , then please buy this mower.

Height adjusters are flimsy but you won't change height much so just be gentle.  I liked the AWD for my new 16 degree sloped lawn.  Be careful as it will take off on you. Very strong pull. Easy start. Don't bother with electronic start IMHO -- unneeded complexity for a problem that stopped existing with improved pull start systems.

Flip the handle up, lock into position, hook the pull rope up and then simply put in gas and oil. The unit took almost the entire bottle of oil that came with the unit (30 wt). Took 2 pulls to get the unit started. This unit has a lot of wheel power with the 4 wheel drive and moves around easily even up hills. \nThe directions are OK but I wish they would separate the English from all the other languages. Makes it hard to find the next step in assembly. One important instruction that needs to be in bold print is about tipping the mower. As many people would do, I tipped the mower over to take a look at the bottom to see the belt drives and how hard it would be to clean. After that, I saw in the manual the comment about NOT tipping the mower when it has a full tank of gas. The plastic mulch plug was a bit deformed out of the box, but I bent it back into shape so it would stay in place. Cuts grass great and seems to have plenty of cutting power. Interesting was the comment about never having to change the oil. Simply add oil when it gets low! I also like the fact that there is no primer bulb or priming required. Cant get any easier than that!",

            "text": "This is an interesting piece of machinery. It assembled easily out of the box in less than five minutes.. I added the oil and some clean fuel and it cranked on the first pull. Me and my fellows all gave it a good test run on our very rough wooded yard. The height is very easy to adjust on all four wheels. The wheel size seemed to be just right. I removed the mulching plug and put the mower to use. The rear discharge is neat because it doesn't throw grass or rocks to the side limiting you to mow in one direction. The shoot did stop up a few times when mowing over some tall weeds or piles of leaves. I think it would do the same with wet grass. The bagger works just fine and hangs easily on the rear rack. The all-wheel drive will move you along. It runs at a pretty fast pace requiring some special care when working in tight spots, but it gets the job done on larger areas. The engine power seemed to match the pace and it pushed on through even thick leaf piles. Turning is pretty easy if you release the drive just for a second. My yard is very hilly and I found this mower worked well to power up the hill and then roll backwards on the rear wheels. It continued to crank on one pull for me and my sons. The handle is a pretty comfortable grip with not too much pad. The blade held up well to sticks and nuts under my trees. The tread on the wheels is aggressive enough for every spot I tested it on allowing for single hand mowing over much of my yard. Time will tell if so much open area under the deck with the drive belt and pulleys being exposed will cause issues with clogging and jamming. There are two exposed pulleys that are plastic and much of the diverted under the deck is plastic. The weight of the mower is a consideration if you do not need all wheel drive, but a great aid to traction if you do. I had some debris piling up behind the engine as I mowed, but this may just be due to the volume of leaves I had on this first mowing. I did not use the hose cleaning port this time, but probably will after mowing grass that is damp. I am looking forward to watching my boys mow more and they like the cool look of the mower. It is very easy to start!",

            "text": "Having great respect for the Husqvarna brand from experience with their motorcycles and chain saws, my initial excitement with this all wheel drive mower soon became a disappointment. After several uses it seemed the drive belt had lost tension because the mower self-propelled speed slowed noticeably. I looked but found, incredibly, that there is no drive belt tension adjustment at all, which is very puzzling. Soon the mower wouldn't self-propel at all on wet grass because the loose drive belt simply slipped on the pulley system. I bought a new belt after several months of use, and couldn't believe the amount of mower disassembly necessary to replace it. I'm an aircraft mechanic, and helicopters are less complex than this poorly designed mower. The engine cuts out on steep hills, and the \"variable speed control\" was nice for the very short time it lasted.",

I was excited, my first Husqvarna. I bought is specifically to mow the grass under my bushes.I get home start using it, the first thing I notice, is the front clutch did not automatically disengage when I released the bar. I had to push the mower forward a little bit to get the clutch to disengage. I could live with that. Then as I was pushing the mower under the bushes to cut the grass, the gas cap would periodically pop off. I could live with that. Last week, the nut that holds the handle to the mower deck popped off. Therefore, I bought a new nylon lock one today and fixed it. I could live with that.After fixing my brand new Husqvarna, I take it out and start mowing under the bushes. I get under the first one and I hear a crunch and see plastic in the lawn.  I investigate and it is the gas cap. It popped off again while mowing under the bush and was run over. After buying the mower to get under the bushes, it was not even good for that.Maybe if I had a lawn without bushes, I would have a different opinion. That is not the case. It will be a LONG time before I even consider look at a Husqvarna ANYTHING again. I will be at Lowes soon to return it, minus a gas cap and with a non-standard lock nut on it.",

I ran it without the bag and I noticed it got clogged a few times but this was my first cut of the season and the grass was tall and patchy. I cut just under a half acre and only used about half a tank of gas which I thought was good for how powerful this motor is. Overall this is a great mower!",

That's terrible quality and durability.  I'm a homeowner, so together with mowing my neighbor's 1/2 acre yard, I only mow two yards in a year in NC for about 6 months.  Each mower's engine failed in a different way, so there seems to be no rhyme or reason.  New, they start out great, mulching or picking up with a bagger everything they should.  But they just don't hold up.  $400 x3= $1200 in five years.  Buy one if you want, but go ahead and start looking atbthe next one you'll have to buy when the Husqvarna craps out.",

Downside is air filter gets dirty fast due to large opening at bottom of cover. I added a piece of soft foam around the bottom half of the filter to reduce debris from clogging airfilter prematurely.2. After 2nd winter storage( gas removed), mower would start and only run for a few seconds then quit. Have always used fresh gas ( only E10 regular gas available here). Changing gas no help. Finally removed black plastic carburetor cover( 4 screws) then cleaned and lubricated butterfly valve and associated fittings. It had been sticking which seems to have caused short run time. Hopefully this was one time event. Ran mower normally for 45minutes.Also, is there a downside risk using 91 octane gas?  All 87 octane regular gas sold here has ethanol, but some stations sell ethanol-free 91 octane.",

            "text": "I purchased this lawn mower right at a year ago and have had zero issues. I have a single lot lawn that I mow so its pretty standard amount to mow for a non commercial mower I presume. Anyways I have never had an issue with the mower bogging down or dying on me when operating except when I get too aggressive mowing grass that's over 8 inches tall and super thick blade stuff that I wouldn't expect any non commercial mower to handle. The self-propelled operation in my opinion is very handy, its not just an on and off operation and you can \"feather\" the self-propelled operation to match the speed you are walking. Also if you want to go backwards with the mower all you have to do is take a step forward after releasing the lever and it disengages and it freely moves like a non propelled mower. The engine does have an interesting sound to me, I thought at first I did not add enough oil since the engine sounded more of a metallic that any other mower I have used but everything checked out and it has always ran just fine picking up clippings correctly and never sputtering. The engine is said to be maintenance free with no need to change the oil but I still changed the oil this year to be safe. I think the most impressive thing for me was the fact that I had the mower stored in my garage over winter so roughly 5 months of no operating and I pulled on the lawnmower 1 time and amazingly it started right up. I will note that I use at least 89 octane 100% gas in it at all times and I did use a fuel stabilizer for storage.",

Not only is the slope a challenge, my yard is surrounded by thorny bramble that I pushed back last year. I don't wish to push it back this year so I'm mowing over that area; sticks, very small stumps, tall weeds. This mower is taking it all. My singular complaint was at start up. If I cut the motor, twice it took 10 minutes before it would start again. I haven't had that problem since the first cut, front and back yard. I'm pleased so far. It's a good even cut, the awd has plenty of pep getting up and down my hill, it's easy to maneuver. To adjust the wheels, each one has to be raised or lower, I wish that were front/back but that's small. I have not used the bag and probably won't. All in all, I'd recommend.

I did a bit better only becuase another Lowes customer returned theirs after one use and decided to buy a rider for their larger lawn. I stood by and then told the Lowes clerk I would like to purchase it since they usually put these used ones out in front at a discount. I had to to wait for it to be serviced per Lowes policy, which was fine. The marked it down to $271.00 so I saved a bit on a one-time used Huqvarna which I have since been delighted with. I've been mowing my own lawn since 1975 and this is by far the best mower I have had yet. Easy to start, spectacular on hills and around obstacles, and I love the Howe-mounted deck cleaning option. A TIP on that: I bought from lowes the Quick-Connect metal hose attachment couplers making it literally a snap to connect and disconnect the hose to the mower, instead of always having to spin on the plastic connector.Summary: I'd buy this again in a heartbeat at both higher and lower priced mowers.",

I have not used bag yet as I usually only mulch. This mower really munched clippings very well. I don't see any clumps left behind. This mower has the Briggs engine which was also on my last mower and that one was still running after 20 years. Overall I'm glad I chose this mower.",

Fast forward to spring 2019, it was time to get the lawn mower out for the first mowing of the year.  I was disappointed to find that my mower wouldn't start, and no I didn't leave any gas in it and I only use ethanol free gas.  I was forced to put my 1 year old mower in the shop for repair.  When I picked it up from the shop, I got some very disappointing news.  First, it wouldn't start because my coil had gone bad, so they replaced it.  Secondly, they said the mower had the wrong blade on it.  My mower had a blade with a 5 point star shaped connection hole on it, and they replaced it with a blade with a circle connection hole on it.  So my 1 year old lawn mower that I paid $349 for at Lowes cost me $129 in repairs the first year I owned it.  I am very disappointed with Husqvarna and definitely have buyer's remorse on this purchase.  Additionally, when I contacted Husqvarna about the problem, they said the blade issue was impossible, that the parts were not interchangeable.",

With that said this is a really nice mower that is well above average. Briggs & Stratton has appropriately named the engine “Easy Start” & I would completely agree. The AWD is impressive. I saw an online debate on whether or not it makes much difference. Let me settle that: there is no debate. This mower pulls... period. It WANTS to go forward & the top speed is a brisk walk. The only drawback I have noticed after the initial cut is that grass collects on the deck behind the engine when using the rear discharge. The life of an air cooled engine is... getting fresh air & there is air vented onto the back of the engine, however grass clippings slowly but surely escape through this vent & build up on the deck. The engineer in me wants correct this, but I am convinced this vent & the air moving through it is also engineered & likely very important. So it will require reaching down every so often & removing the grass. As with anything, only time & usage will yield a valid review but my first impression is very good just not quite a 5 star.",

However, last fall the all wheel drive system stopped working.  I took it to an authorized husqvarna repair shop and the following was replaced: idler pulley assembly (metal flange broken which caused the assembly and belt to hang down onto blade spindle), pulleys (2 of the 3 were cracked), a new belt and blade.  When I got it home, it ran well.   2 months ago, the all wheel drive system stopped working again.  I took it to a different authorized shop and they replaced the cable and front pulley.  They indicated the belt looked burned and recommended a new one.  Great, 2 belts in less then a year.  While cutting my yard yesterday, you guessed it, the all wheel drive system died again.  I checked and everything replaced was in tact.  It must be something else. It now sets by the road with a \"FREE \" sign on it.   I am very disappointed in this Husqvarna product.

            "text": "I was initially impressed with this mower. I had only bought Honda/ Troybilt mowers. Husqvarna has lots of nice features and cuts cleanly. It didn't always start on the first pull, when new and the gas cap tended to fall off if you brushed it against shrubs ( I tied it to the body of the mower with string). The LC 221A model gradually lost speed, while in self propelled mode. The hand cable had started to unravel. Then the self propelled feature quit totally. It seems that their drive belts are not protected from any yard debris. Pine cones, prickly gumballs, pine needles or small stones will slowly destroy the exposed drive belts. Unless you live on a golf course or have no neighbors with trees that produce gumballs or pine cones, skip this one. I am having it repaired and giving it away. It has failed after less than one year.",

            "text": "I have to wright this review since so many out there helped me by reading their reviews. First off I'll say I'm 6 foot, 240. Size does matter when it comes to pushing and controlling these things. That said, this mower was purchased because my wife had so many issues when she would cut the lawn with our old second hand mower. I'll start off by unboxing and assembly. Easy enough. Lifted out of the box, unfolded the handle and tightened. pulled back the start cord and secured in place. Added the included oil, a little gas and it was off to the races. So far after 2 months of use it starts if not with the first pull the second. A few times after a week of sitting in the shed it didn't start until the second pull. My wife does not have any issues starting it. She's about 5'4\" and her upper body strength isn't great, so if she can start it. I think most can. The presences handle is comfortable. Overall grip is comfortable. It doesn't have that Z grip that the old mower had. I hate those things. They are set up for a 14 year old boy. Way to close a grip for an adult. This one is nice and easy to hold. Adjusting the cut height is ease enough. Does not have markings in inch's. Just a simple adjustment. There is no prime bulb. You just pull once you grip the handle and the presences handle together. The handle that engages the wheels is comfortable for me. It has a progressive system. When you hold the handle fully to the mower handle it's full speed. My stride is about 29 inch's. In a straight path I have the system fully engaged and the walk is not a slow walk but a comfortable quick walk. I am 60 and have had issues with my legs not wanting to work in the past. I don't have issues with the speed and like it for the exercise and strengthening of my legs. So far no issues here. Back to my wife. The top speed is a little quick for her, and this is the con on this mower. Since she is a small person her hands are small also. She has trouble gripping the lever to engage the drive system. It's a progressive system and her hands are not big enough to control it at the slower speeds. This is where fatigue in her hands kicks in. She never really has a comfortable grip on the handle for the slower speeds. So if your hands are small you may have issues here. I don't have a problem so, so far No issues. I didn't think that AWD system was needed, but it does make a difference. I can't say enough about how I like this mower. It mulches fine. It came with a grass catcher. I mulch so mulching was important to me. So far not seeing big clumps of grass anywhere. I move at least once a week unless we got lots of ran or when we are putting stuff down on the lawn to make the grass grow faster. For the price this does a great job. Time will tell how it holds up. Much is care of the machine to make it last. That I plan on doing. Nope this does not stay running and disengage the blades whale you pick things up. It's an easy pull to start back up again. I figure I can live without that feature. A friend just picked up a mower that does that but he paid twice as much. I think I can live with out that. I wish I could talk about the bagging system but I don't use that. I would rather mulch and put grass back into the ground then add to a dump site. I'll end this with saying It's a great mower.",

            "text": "I purchased this and have used it only once so far, and I plan to return it today for something else...I had no issues with the quality and evenness of the cut. The self propel is quite fast so if you're not cutting larger denser areas, you can work very quickly, though since it's a single speed, this can be a con for some. Easy assembly. You pull it out of the box, and attach the handle.The design of the self propel handle is poorly thought out and/or not tested by someone who will be using the thing for more than a few minutes at a time. The handle is entirely too long and I don't have tiny hands either. More often than not, you're only running it around half speed because it's so fast, which means your hand is always in an adjusting gripping motion causing fatigue and discomfort. Additionally, the angle at which you have to hold the self propel handle caused a lot of wrist pain by the time I finished the job. Instead of just holding your arms out in front of you and holding the handle, you have to hold them in front of you, AND THEN bend your hands downwards to reach the handle. Also, I ended up pinching my fingers multiple times with the handle itself. It's just not comfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time, and my yard takes 40 minutes. This dropped it to 2 stars for me. From an ergonomic standpoint, it's not a good product at all. The whole point of a lawnmower is to be able to use it, and people aren't buying self propelled gas mowers for tiny yards. It needs to be comfortable to use for a long enough period of time.",

            "text": "This has been the best mower I have owned in all my years of mowers. My yard is hilly and the grass is deep. My two wheel drive mower had to be pushed to help it up the incline of my yard, this AWD goes up the inclines with ease, I just pull the handle and walk behind it. It has great reserve power whenever its needed. It was much faster than I cared for so I put a spacer the drive bar so it doesn't engage as far as before and the speed is much better now. What I've also noticed is how light weight this mower feels. It is very easy to maneuver, I have rocks, trees and landscaping to drive around and its so easy to change direction. I've had zero issues with my mower with the exception it was tight for the first two or three starts. It has since loosened up due to breaking in as is normal. Final words, this is a great mower and I am happy with my purchase. Thank you Husqvarna for a great durable product.",

            "text": "I highly recommend tightening all the nuts everywhere. The first problem in less than 4 months of owning this, is the drive cable has gone slack. On a level yard, I reckon you wouldn't have this problem, but with a slope where you really need the AWD to get you up it, it doesn't hold up. (Currently trying to find out how to tighten it, but YouTube videos are lacking of the newer model) As of now, I got to pull the handle and then use my fingers to tug on the cable. The second problem was watching the handle fall off. One of the nuts had vibrated lose right off the bolt and disappeared. Why they didn't use the lock nuts is beyond me. (Assuming those nuts with plastic inside are called lock nuts.)Yeah, it's pretty easy to start up and use...  Just not for a larger yard or one with hills. The mulch feature may be great for leaves, but not for damp grass. It doesn't take long at all for the clump mess to build up and you may find yourself having to remove grass just to start it back up. It's not powerful enough to go through a modestly difficult yard. If you mow every week and manage not to have rain, you are good. If you try to go two weeks or there has been a rain...  Best of luck. I had to get a rider because it was just too much work getting this thing to do the job. Unless of course you are looking for a grueling workout!I have gotten pretty good with doing lawns over the years and I've learned the best trick to keep yard motors running is to use non ethanol gas so you don't have gunk buildup in the carbs. (At least make the last couple mows of the season use non ethanol gas so you can flush out the corn mess) I have cleaned, repaired, and replaced more carbs than I care to admit because of ethanol in the gas. So working on lawn mowers isn't new to me, I just love to watch a video first so I know what to expect. I seriously didn't expect to have to do any repairs in the first season though! Had I got through this season, I'd have given it more stars as I understand lawn mowers don't last long. But the AWD was one of the best features. To have to tug the wire to get it to engage is just ridiculous this soon! I'd highly recommend buyers invest in the models that give you the option of using the side discharge. It will come in handy for tall and/or damp grass.",

            "text": "TL;DR-Engine is underpowered for thick spots-Mulch gathers too easily under the deck-All-wheel drive is poorly designed and exposed to mulch and debris from the blades-Fuel tank is very small compared to other mowers-Parts missing from the mower right out of the box (wheel height grip)I purchased this mower in the store, enticed by the All-wheel drive. Husqvarna WAS a name known for quality, but this mower did not live up to the name.Right out of the box, I fueled and oiled the machine and went to work on the lawn. It was my first cutting of the season, so the grass was a bit taller than normal. I have level terrain (about 1/2 acre), partly shaded (the grass grows thicker in the shade and can be moist). The weather had been dry for several days and I cut in the afternoon on a sunny day.Right off the bat, the mower bogged down and had difficulty with the thicker patches of grass. Several times, the engine stalled because of mulch buildup under the blades. I then went to adjust the deck height only to find out that one the the height adjust handles was missing a grip. The mower performed only slightly better raised up, the engine continued to struggle and stall as mulch began to collect under the deck, rather than being returned to the soil.After completing a complete cut, I allowed the lawn to rest for two days before going over it again, with the deck lowered considerably for a close cut. The engine performed a little better this time as the grass wasn't quite as thick anymore and I thought perhaps this mower was alright after all. Then I hit a stick. This is something that every mower has encountered at one time or another, the stray stick or branch from your shade trees. Either dropped recently, or hidden in the grass, I do not know. Once the mower hit the stick, it encountered little difficulty turning it to mulch, but not before disabling the All-wheel drive system. Upon investigation, it seems the drive system uses a belt that runs under the deck and is EXPOSED TO THE MULCH! The belt and pulleys where all COVERED in MULCH! After clearing the mulch, I realized that a pulley came loose from being struck by the stick, causing the belt to slip. Not a difficult fix, but not one I should have to make after three days of ownership.  Needless to say, with a 30 day return policy, it is going back to the store.",

I ended up having to call husqvarna to refer me to a shop to look at them,, they said the push mower needed new carbs, new fuel lines ect,, on a mower that had been ran on and off for 30 days,, got it back ran it once then again same issues, then the tiller had issues wasn't running right,  took them  back to shop they said the was acting up needed replaced again so now we are again with out our mower and tiller for weeks during the summer , then the rider had same issues, we did work ourselves tired of waiting weeks for our equipment back.  rider worked good then started having battery issues,, our tiller they could never get to run right and husqvarna would never do nothing to help,, so I have this brand new tiller that no shops around here can get to run right just being a shop ornament,, the push mower still won't start,, and the tiller is dead,, 3 brand new husqvarna equipment all with issues barely have got to use in a year due to all the issues with them.  I will never buy another husqvarana anything, never had any issues with the john deer mowers,, or the cheap mowers/tillers we have bought,, we have had a troy built tiller we have ran for years and keeps on going,, wasted our money and can't get no one to get them going.  they lost our business",

I used this primarily to mow my 15' x 50' front lawn during the summer months (bermuda grass), mulch leaves and grass in the fall, and mow the 40' x 70' back lawn (rye and fescue) during the spring.  It worked great for a few months.  The first problem encountered was the drive lever cable stretching out so it would not engage the drive belt.  Shortly after that was fixed the plastic shroud under the deck that concealed the drive pulleys broke.  That was replaced and then the drive pulleys seized up.  Then the problems began with the Briggs and Stratton engine.  The automatic choke seems to have failed and is extremely difficult to start, if at all.  The mower was washed with the deck washing port on the mower after each use.  The spark plug and air filter were also cleaned regularly and changed this spring (2018).  Overall, very disappointed with this mower.  I do not feel Husqvarna are worth buying after this experience.",

Was concerned about some of the reviews on this website about the engine but went ahead and  bought it.  Big mistake!  The new one has been nothing but trouble from start.  First week, it would not start after mowing 2/3 of yard.  Went to back Lowe's to see if something wasn't connected right or what might be going on.  Two employees said it was hot day and let cool down  since it was in break in period and check the air filter.  After it cooled down and with several pulls, it started.  This now this happens all the time!  Im getting old and pulling the cord multiple times is not easy and don't like having to wait on lawn mower to cool down to finish job.  In addition, the AWD now seems to work intermittently.  Called Lowe's about the issue and asked if I could replace it by upgrading to Honda engine as it had better reviews. Their response was you have to bring in for repair and then they will decide from there - what does that mean?  Why do I have to spend more money for a poor product?  Am a very loyal customer at Lowe's but this is a crappy Briggs and Stratton engine.  Stuck with a lemon and not happy with Lowe's customer service.",

I went from a 30 year old lawn boy, I can say it's about like going from a 5 year old ford truck to a new high end bmw car on how it works.  Starts on the second pull most always if not the first.  I had my hesitations at first being a brigs and stration engine since I've had experience on their older engines  in the starting area, some of the old briggs were really hard to start, this one not at all.  Seems to be a whole lot better on gas than the older lawn boy I had.  I mow on a little bit of a hill and the all wheel self propelled is great in that area.  if you mow around bushes/trees or get into a corner will roll without the self propelled yet not free rolling, can tell there is a belt tension on the wheels yet nothing I would be worried about for myself.  Only thing I will mention the gas cap will come off easy, brushed it against a bush limb a time or two and came right off.  For me that is really the only thing I will mention that could be worked on.  I used the mower enough to already sharpen the blade after 5 months so it's been worked out pretty good and had over all held up good.  I used a synthetic oil as recommended in the manual I could use being I use the same oil on other equipment I have, still working good.",

Overall, the performance was great until the 3rd attempt to use it shut down all the way. We took it into the Lowe's store because it is a push mower and not a ride on so they have to try to repair it at another facility. Well, they come back telling me that the crank shaft was broken, engine needs to be replaced, blade was damaged and they couldn't repair that under the manufacturer's warranty nor the extended warranty. Junk, bull and waste of money. How in the world could all of that have been broken if it worked perfectly fine in August, it just magically broke and now we can't use it and the repairs would most likely cost as much as the lawn mower.",

The AWD is awesome and I just have to lightly engage the AWD to have the mower take off--I popped a wheelie the 1st time I used it. I always mulch and this beast has no problem. The wheels and tires are solid and grippy--with the AWD I have no problem gliding over wet/muddy areas where I got stuck with my old mower. According to the sales associated the AWD mechanical system is supposed to be all metal & belts unlike other brands that make self-propelled systems which can have a lot of plastic in them. The hose hookup and cleaning mechanism is not that great but I have never experienced one of those that work to really clean the underside--they don't seem worth the hassle. If I get the hose out I just squirt the underside of the deck by hand. Great mower for the price - got a memorial day special which brought down the price more.",

The wheels were easy to adjust and it started on the first pull.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the bag was small and the mounting bracket was difficult to get the bag on. Additionally, the mulching device was not attached. It is a separate device which I can see getting lost if you don't use it for a while.\n\nI have now mowed my yard 3 times with this mower.\n\nThe big problem for me which causes me to not recommend the mower is the self-propel lever. It is okay if you are running it at full speed. At full speed, the safety lever and self-propelled lever are together at the handle and easily gripped. If you want to run at less than full speed, you have to open up your grip which makes it difficult to control and fatiguing on your hand. I also pinched my fingers multiple times engaging the self-propelled lever.\n\nThe self-propel issues may go away after using the mower for a while. I like the Thumb-Controlled Self-Propelled device on another major brand mower.\n\nThe mower does a nice job on zoysia grass. It has a very smooth cut right out of the box. I did not sharpen the blade.\n\nIf Husqvarna can come up with a better design on the self-propel lever, they'll have a good mower.",

The third time I used it, I made it through half of the front yard and started to hear a mechanical pinging. I immediately shutdown and gave the engine a quick inspection. Didn't see anything obvious, so I attempted to fire it back up to listen again but couldn't get it to start. Waited 30 minutes before trying again and it fired on the first pull. The engine sounded normal initially so I went back to work. Made it 40' across the yard and the engine began misfiring, bogged down and died. I reboxed the mower and exchanged it for an identical unit. I've not had any issues with the new mower; However, it has only been used twice (fingers crossed).Overall the mower is easy to operate and the AWD really helps on uneven ground. I believe the first mower I received was a lemon and would consider purchasing again. My only complaint would be when not using the bag to catch clippings, the rear discharge ensures your feet and ankles will get dirty but does prevent the mower from slinging rocks.",

After a couple weeks I noticed that it started to run a little rough, and I'd have to make several passes to get even results. In the spring, the pull cord would get stuck, but the mower would start reluctantly, the first time I used it for the season. After a few starts and stops the cord would pull back. At this point I took it in to be serviced and was told the crank shaft was bent. \"Not worth putting money in to.\" I was told. \"Should have gone with the Honda engine\" they recommended. Now I have a $300+ paper-weight. Here's the thing, though: the customer service line told me to take it in to a different service center to see if they'd repair it \"under warranty\". I called back to ask if there was any other solution, and that rep told me that a service center may be able to \"pirate the necessary part from another mower to reduce the cost of repair.\" I'm extraordinarily dissatisfied with the craftsmanship of the mower, but moreso with the level of professionalism and service I received from Husqvarna.",

            "text": "I bought this mower shortly after purchasing my house. I bought it for the AWD, since my backyard is uneven and sloped with many dips/holes.  This mower has started on the first pull every time. The AWD gets it out of any pit I've put it in, and the mower itself has chewed up everything my yard has thrown at it.  Putting the side discharge at the rear is a great design, as I can get right up against obstacles on either side. The negative to that is that the discharge doesn't seat securely, so it has a tendency to get knocked off, although not that frequently.My major gripe with this mower has to do with the interaction between the mulch plug and the AWD. When you want to pull the mower backwards, make sure you've disengaged the AWD and pushed it forward for a short bit first. If you don't, then the drive will still be engaged, and will fight you.  With the mulch plug in, the AWD will try to engage all on its own, even when I hadn't used it at all since starting the mower that time.All in all, this mower has performed better than I could've expected, and I highly recommend it.",

            "text": "Most of the reviews I see on here are user error. I have bad arthritis and the VARIABLE speed of the AWD make using it a dream. I've never had to pull the start rope more than 3 times BUT there are a couple things I wish they would change. After 30 minutes of use if I turn it off to refuel I have to wait about 5 minutes for it to cool down a little before it will restart. But thats a small price to pay for the ease of starting every other time. One other thing thats a bit of an issue is the drive belts under the deck do not have a cover and if something like a pebble or wood chip gets caught in the drive pulley the mower won't move or start. I had to take mine to the dealer for repair to learn this. The dealer just showed me the problem at no charge so the only other time its happened was an easy fix. The deck washing hose connection is of little use but nice to have. Overall I recommend this mower. AWD mowers are hard to find and usually very expensive. For the price this unit has been a life/money saver for a crippled old man like me. Pulling it backwards requires it be pushed forward about 3 or 4 inches to disengage the AWD",

            "text": "I bought this mower last July in 2018, it was used as a 2nd mower and not my primary. I like the power of it, the look and it truly is a 1 pull start machine. I used this thing maybe 7 times before season changed. In spring 2019 for the first cut I fired it up and was off. Only problem is the AWD wouldn't engage, tried it a couple more times and the belt burned up. Good thing it was April, I took it to a certified dealer for repairs. Here's the issue. HUSQVARNA created this machine with the pulley system and drive belt completely exposed. Then they attempted to cover the front and rear diffs. However, that just creates a huge void space. Grass collects there and gets stuck, used the hose attachment but that doesn't clean the drive motors. I had to take the back wheels off, and nearly the entire bottom plastic to clean it out. So right in the center where the pulleys and belt are... the is no protection, so the pulleys get jammed up with grass and the potential of the belt being cut is high. I got the mower fixed but now the front gear does not disengage unless I turn the thing off. Should have gone with the Briggs I was looking at.",

Our yards all vary in terrain, with the front having a very large hill, and the 2 other sections having large flat sections bordered by steady grades. That being said, I knew I wanted a propelled mower. This particular model fit the price point for keeping me under what I had been quoted for having a service mow at the intervals our yard needs. Setup was easy, basically just unfold the handles once it's out of the box. AWD and the rear left discharge have been legit for cutting back tall stuff.  Since I was about 2 weeks behind on cutting this year I switched between bagging, and the rear discharge for getting it down to a manageable length. The last 2 times I've cut I've just mulched.  The drive is engaged by pulling up on the lower handle, so, tightening or loosening your grip makes the pace variable. I am kinda peeved by the way the drive belt and pully's are exposed under the deck, but I keep that area clean after I use it, so no problems so far. I do use the deck wash attachment. It helps loosen up everything, but don't expect not to have to get your hands a little dirty to keep the deck clean. All that being said, I wish I could afford a riding mower. But, this mower is worth every penny.",

It had a feature that allowed the engine to run but stopped the blade so you didn't have to restart it every time you needed to empty the bag, which I dearly miss and forgot to shop for when looking for a replacement. However, I was teaching my 12yo boy to mow the lawn and bought this one for us. It has been a month and both he and I have used it. It starts like a dream, no primer bulb, just pull the cord and it starts right up. The AWD is very powerful as I have a couple of small spots with and incline and loose soil that the RWD would spin out on, where this one goes right over without any loss of traction. I have two small complaints but I would still recommend the machine. 1) No side chute, I have been searching for an aftermarket compatible one, with little luck. Apparently many manufacturers are going away from the chute. 2) While the speed is technically \"variable\" it is dependant on how close you pull the drive lever towards the handle. It is not terribly comfortable to hold the lever an inch away from the handle while mowing, nor are you able to hold a consistent speed. I much prefer a preset adjustable drive speed lever to keep speed consistent. The boy loves this mower (more then the JD) so as long as he is cutting the lawn I am happy.",

            "text": "I'm surprised of the low ratings this mower has because I have mine two years now and it's the best mower I've ever used but it has one quirk which I'll address now. If you use the self propelled feature, release the drive bar and immediately stop the mower the 4 wheels seem to stay in 4wd and is hard to pull backwards although the mower isn't prepelling itself anymore.  The workaround is to let off the drive bar and while the mower is moving under it's own momentum push it ahead another inch or two and the wheels will turn spin freely. After a little while you'll get the hang of it and it becomes a non-issue.Now briefly the rest.....I have a yard and not a lawn, follow me? I'll let the grass, crab grass and weed get a little high and this baby cuts beautifully and even mulches with out clumping, the grass catcher packs tight with clippings and holds alot before needing emptied and it's easy to remove and install. Mine is 163cc and I wouldn't want it any smaller. My yard drops about 4 feet at a 45º angle to the road out front and the 4wd pulls itself up and down the bank with one hand, no sweating in the hot sun. The self cleaning garden hose connection is kind of a joke but that's with all mowers, I have a paint scrapper tool I use to keep the clippings from building up under the deck. Clippings tend to build up under the front cover but that's easy to clean out. All mowers need maintenance throughout the summer. As with ALL power equipment don't use gas with ethanol, usually the middle and high grade gas doesn't have it. I'm buying another Husky to keep at my mom's house for her yard.",

            "text": "I'm surprised of the low ratings this mower has because I have mine two years now and it's the best mower I've ever used but it has one quirk which I'll address now. If you use the self propelled feature, release the drive bar and immediately stop the mower the 4 wheels seem to stay in 4wd and is hard to pull backwards although the mower isn't prepelling itself anymore.  The workaround is to let off the drive bar and while the mower is moving under it's own momentum push it ahead another inch or two and the wheels will turn spin freely. After a little while you'll get the hang of it and it becomes a non-issue.Now briefly the rest.....I have a yard and not a lawn, follow me? I'll let the grass, crab grass and weed get a little high and this baby cuts beautifully and even mulches with out clumping, the grass catcher packs tight with clippings and holds alot before needing emptied and it's easy to remove and install. Mine is 163cc and I wouldn't want it any smaller. My yard drops about 4 feet at a 45º angle to the road out front and the 4wd pulls itself up and down the bank with one hand, no sweating in the hot sun. The self cleaning garden hose connection is kind of a joke but that's with all mowers, I have a paint scrapper tool I use to keep the clippings from building up under the deck. Clippings tend to build up under the front cover but that's easy to clean out. All mowers need maintenance throughout the summer. As with ALL power equipment don't use gas with ethanol, usually the middle and high grade gas doesn't have it. I'm buying another Husky to keep at my mom's house for her yard.",

I cleaned the dirt from around the outside of the carb and sprayed wd-40 on the area where the valve shaft is connected ( NOT on the valve itself).

The further toward the handle the drive bail is pulled, the faster the mower will travel. You stop by releasing the brake handle or the drive bail, and can stop the forward motion without stopping the engine itself by releasing the drive bail only. The self-propelled feature isn't like cruise control where it holds a certain speed. It's more that the mower propels forward without having to push the mower.

Purchase fuel in quantities that can be used within 30 days to assure fuel freshness. You only need to add fuel stabilizer when mower will be stored for a long period of time, especially for winter storage. But it's recommended that you empty fuel from your mower before storing, so you wouldn't need stabilizer at all unless you choose NOT to empty the tank. Gasoline that sits in your mower's fuel tank for months and months degrades, gets stale, and even thickens, eventually clogging the carburetor and fuel lines in the system. It also attracts moisture, which can lead to corrosion. It's best to empty all fuel prior to storing your mower for winter. Should you choose NOT to empty the fuel prior to storing your mower, it's a good idea to add a fuel stabilizer to the tank, and run the engine for at least 10 minutes to give the stabilizer a chance to flow through the entire fuel system. Fuel stabilizer is an acceptable alternative to avoid tacky deposits during storage. Always follow the mix ratio found on stabilizer container. Do not empty the gas tank and carburetor if using fuel stabilizer. Thank you so much for considering Husqvarna for your outdoor power equipment needs.",

                    "text": "Good question Ray. In some ways, it's about preference, but your yard type can help you determine which drive system is ideal. Most self-propelled walk-behind lawn mowers are front-wheel-drive (FWD), and are best for level terrain or yards with small slopes. Also, since the drive wheels are in front, it's easy to tip the mower up so you can turn it easier than with other drive systems – especially when you get to the end of your mowing path and need to turn the other way. Rear-wheel-drive (RWD) provides more traction at the center of the mower, helping you mow hilly terrain easily. And finally, all-wheel-drive (AWD) models provide power to all four wheels, making them best for hilly terrain, uneven terrain, and tougher mowing conditions. All of these drive systems are combined with self-propelling, and together, make the mower do the hard work for you -- especially versus a mower you have to actually push! Hope that helps with your decision. For what it's worth, I have one of all-wheel-drive Husqvarna models and LOVE it! Well, I should say my 14-year-old son loves it since he does the mowing! Thank you so much for considering Husqvarna for your outdoor power equipment needs.",

First things first, and please don't be offended, but your mower ships without fuel or oil. Did you add them before trying to start it? If so, it could be that you need to connect the spark plugs. My best recommendation is that you refer to your user manual for step-by-step instructions on getting the mower up and running.

Considering the 675 EXi engine does not require oil changes but just \"top offs\", I purchased a quart of the B&S full synthetic to lube the engine instead of the oil included with the mower. Should be a lifetime supply for just a few dollars more. More info from B&S: https://www.briggsandstratton.com/na/en_us/support/faqs/browse/mower-oil-type-and-capacity.html#ChoosingOilType",

Use SAE 30 in warmer outdoor temperatures of 40° F and higher (5° C and higher). Use SAE 10W-30 for a varying temperature range of 0 to 100° F (-18 to 38° C). This grade of oil improves cold weather starting, but may increase oil consumption when outdoor temperature is 80° F (27° C) or higher. A synthetic oil SAE 5W-30 is the best for very cold temperatures of -20° F to as high as 120° F (-30 to 40° C) providing the best protection at all temperatures as well as improved starting with less oil consumption.

The PremierCut™ deck provides better air flow which allows the grass blades to spin across the blades multiple times allowing them to cut them into a smaller size. Another benefit of this style of deck is the wheels are inside the deck (not protruding out) which allows for improved trimming close to objects.

Federal regulations require an engine control to be installed on lawn mowers in order to minimize the risk of blade contact injury. With that said, all walk-behind lawn mowers are made to shut down when you release the engine brake handle. The engine brake is designed to stop the engine. When the grip on the engine brake handle is released, the engine should stop and the drive should disengage, and blades stop turning. You should not, under any circumstances, attempt to defeat the function of the operator control. Thank you so much for choosing Husqvarna for your outdoor power equipment needs.",

To avoid the wheels from locking up, the operator should allow the unit to roll forward a couple inches after letting go of the drive control.

Although it may sound a bit strange, some people use cooking spray or oil to help clean grass off mower blades. While you're at it, it's a good time to have your blades sharpened. Keeping your lawn mower blades clean and sharp is just as important as engine maintenance when it comes to ensuring equipment performance and longevity. Dull mower blades can unevenly rip or shred grass, leaving it torn, dry, and susceptible to disease. Replacing or sharpening the blade(s) on your mower blade will ensure a healthy lawn. Remember, blades are sharp, and can cause serious injury! Please, please make sure you follow the instructions in your user manual for removing blades or attempting any cleaning or maintenance.
