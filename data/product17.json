The people complaining about the water spots and puddling are just being overly particular.  I have not had any issues.  Oh and its SOOOO DEEP.  No more water splashing everywhere when washing dishes.  Does not sound like a tin can either.  like I said, solid.  It comes with some nice accessories also; all you need to hook it up.  Only caution i have is the depth of the sink can mess up your drain configuration underneath with a garbage disposal.  I had to completely redo my plumbing to the drain line.

So for new building, the plumber can accommodate the extended size. But for our 70's-ish house, it caused a problem. The plumber had to replace these with standard drains, booo ! The sink is deep and a nice  heavy gauge. I wish we could have seen this in the store before purchase. I don't remember seeing this listed in the detail section of the sink (on Lowes.com) I still would purchase this sink tho. It's a (IMO) commercial grade. I hope to get many years enjoyment ......definitely worth the extra money. The others (in the store) seemed so cheaply made",

I love the look, the styling, the workmanship. You know you've bought quality the minute you set your eyes on it. The faucet disconnects and reconnects easily but stays in place as it should. The spray feature cleans my dishes nicely of food particle and is hard enough to remove stubborn particle before putting in the dishwasher. This faucets eliminates the need for a separate sprayer which as you can see in the picture made it possible for me to install a soap dispenser. I love it! I would buy this again.",

I took a chance on a brand that I knew nothing about that you don't hear of often and I couldn't be happier. I'm a deep research type of person and I read a lot of reviews. There weren't many on this faucet but all that I read were positive. This faucet is SOLID! I don't have to clean finger print smudges, built up crud, and most of all I don't have to worry about a flimsy recess cord.

Install was simple and straightforward. Best of all, my wife absolutely loves this and thanks me every day for buying and installing.

Product was carefully packaged in Styrofoam, cardboard, and a separate bag to prevent scratches. The sink itself is a decently-heavy gauge material with a nice scratch-free finish. Appears to be stamped from a single sheet and corners have a nice generous radius. Flanges and edges are nicely deburred. Was pleasantly surprised to find the entire backside covered with a layer of sound dampening material, instead of the typical few small pads. Was provided with mounting brackets as well as machine screws and glue-in threaded inserts for use with a solid surface or granite counter top. Has great accessories. The included drying rack is well-made and includes not only plastic anti-scratch pads installed but a little bag of extra pads a well. The included drain is well-made and has a nice pull-out basket to make cleaning easy.Lowes should promote this product and stock it in their stores.",

It even dinged when I accidently hit a cleaver on the divider while washing it and placing it over to the other side.  I wouldn't even say it was a hard strike on the steel.  Also do note that the divider is the same height as the all around edge of the sink.This was the first stainless steel sink for us, but for the price I thought the steel would be harder than the cheaper ones, guess I was wrong on that or I just needed to get the $1k ones..You'd pretty much have to baby this sink if you want to keep it nice.",

I purchased some washers to add support. The other is I'm not a huge fan of the mounting hardware. A perfect 3/8 hole with a forstner bit was too tight a fit. The little mounts crushed rather than go in. Expanding the hole led to a couple not fitting tight enough. The added supports for $5 in hardware give me peace of mind, however. Otherwise, I'm happy with the price and the included accessories. The template was cut a little unevenly, but we worked around that with sanding.  \nLooking forward to years of use.",

It took longer to pull everything out from under the counter, than it did to install. It is very heavy, and seems to be made very well. It even has under-the-sink adjustments that allows it to be plumbed and squared quickly. It looks great with my farmhouse sink and has amazing water pressure as well!

The sink cleans up well, looks professional, and we are very happy with it.  The greatest downside is the almost flat bottom.  It is more difficult to rinse out and get all the debris down the drain or to the disposal.  The build quality is excellent.  I much prefer welded construction to pressed steel and it screams quality. It is also well insulated (quiet).  I would highly recommend this sink to anyone who would put quality, workmanship, practicality and size over a more stylish (in some peoples opinion) sink. I love it.  We do not use the bottom racks as they do not seem to add any improvement to an already fine sink. We also did not install the deep strainer basket, as we find the standard one more than adequate.",

The single basin is ideal for cleaning those big pots and pans and the metal grate on the bottom continues to live in our sink as it helps with water/waste flow. Also the 16 gauge means it's quiet! The fact it doesn't have pre-drilled faucet/dispenser holes means you can have more flexibility in what accessories to buy which ended up being a huge benefit. Again totally love it, would recommend to anyone looking for an undermount sink.",

The grate is a nice touch - it's helpful not only for keeping the bottom from scratching, but also for example when you need to drain a large pot without getting other things you have in there wet. I worried about some reviews about debris not draining well because the bottom is too flat, but I found a good system to work around it - just blast the spray faucet at the tops of the four corners just below the countertop, and everything gets washed down the drain quickly and easily. The strainer is easy to pull out with the grate still in place and the grate is easy to lift up on one side to give a quick soapy wipe-down to keep bottom sanitized.",

Double - basinThe size and depth allows for a lot of items to be kept in the sink and not appear to be piled up. But most important for me was keeping the mess to a minimum. Our previous shallow sink had a lot of water splash back on to the counters. That is all but eliminated now. I prefer a dual-basin because it allows us to have one side exclusive for a garbage disposal. I like that it is smaller than the other side even if only slightly smaller (60/40). Appears to be durable and a good look for what we were going for. I also like that it comes with the additional features like the floor grates. Small thing but saves some money from having to purchase them. Really enjoying this sink.",

            "text": "We're currently in the middle of a DIY kitchen renovation and decided to switch from the typical 90's builder-grade two-bowl stainless steel to a single-bowl undermount sink.  After doing a bit of research, we came across the Kraus brand.  While we hadn't ever heard of the brand, the reviews on literally every one of their products (basically 4.9 *'s) were undeniable.  We decided to give Kraus a shot and are SO glad we did.\n\nPros:\n- Huge profile - almost to the point that we wished we'd gone with a 28\" sink.\n- Deep bowl\n- Clean lines\n- Installation instructions are clear and straightforward; will take some planning for each customer's specific application\n- High-grade stainless steel w/ noise dampeners (silverware \"thuds\" when dropped into the sink rather than the annoying \"clanging\")\n\nCons:\n- Mounting hardware can interfere w/ top of base cabinet even if cabinet meets minimum width/depth specs (our cabinet was 33 1/2\" wide).  Ours did, so we simply notched out the top of the base cabinet where there was interference\n- Holes specified for mounting hardware were too small for the actual plastic \"female\" pieces; we adapted by chamfering the starts of the holes so the pieces could get started\n\nOverall, beautiful product, and we're excited for it to be a focal point of our kitchen for years to come!",

            "text": "This sink is hands down the most superior in quality I have ever seen, installed or had the pleasure to use. I have been in the luxury and fine home-building industry for almost two decades and this sink is one of the best I have ever had the pleaseure to install. And, lucky me, I get to actually use this one on a daily basis in my own home! I have always been a stickler for a deep sink. But usually having a deep sink means that you get noise that could easily rival that of Niagara Falls when the faucet is running. Kraus knows that and solved that problem with their under-sink dampening system. THAT feature alone has me sold! The accessories Kraus included don't hurt either. But on to the most important \"perk\" that Kraus included..... The drain kit! Be still my beating heart... Why is this so important you ask? Keeping in mind that a large percentage of consumer end kitchen sinks do NOT come with a drain kit. This leaves the installer, contractor or even the occasional DIY'er with only a few options... Option 1: they call up the manufacturer of the sink they purchased, without a drain kit, and order one directly from them. Meanwhile, you wait for the manufactured to pack it up and ship it. Option 2: make a trip to a local home improvement store in the hopes you can find one that is going to match the specs of the sink you purchased, again without a drain kit. Option 3: in the case of replacing a preexisting sink with the new one you bought, without an included drain kit, the old drain kit is used. So, again, why is it an awesome and important feature for Kraus to include with their already amazing sink? Because 99% of the time a generic, 2nd party manufacturer or even an \"authorized manufacturer\" drain kit is not going to fit the drain opening exactly. \"Who cares\" You ask? You should care because the drain opening and the drain kit that go into should be, in my opinion, the \"heart\" of a sink. Especially for a one bowl/one-drain-opening sink. The quality, or lack thereof, of the seal can determine the longevity of the sink, cabinetry and everything below it. Having a perfect seal at the drain opening not only ensures that you will not have any leaks, it will also ensure that they integrity and strength of that sink is going to last beyond your lifetime. This sink and the included drain kit? PERFECTION! I know beyond any shadow of a doubt that I will never have to worry about the sink or what is below it!My rating....10 Stars for quality10 Stars for value and price10 stars for easy install",
