When we needed to paint  exterior of the master suite we had a hard time matching into the existing paint. We then tried Weather Shield. The coverage was great! Lowes also did a perfect job on the color match! You can tell the difference when applying it that this was a good paint! Arizona has harsh heat and strong monsoons and it has lasted great againt those odds. This product is now highly favorable in our company. I 100% recommend it!

We did usetwo coats on rafters and posts, but paint applies easily and covers well.  So far after a year of humidity, rain, mud splashing up, there is no wear on the paint, no cracking, no peeling.  We applied directly to the aged wood as this painthas a primer mixed in.  It is not inexpensive, but is worth the price, and we are going to use it again for a new shed.",

I then applied two coats to the fascia around the entire exterior of my home. We have had a few heavy rainstorms in the month since I completed this project and the paint is holding up perfectly.  Time will tell if the paint will hold up for another ten years, but so far I am pleased with the purchase, and the reputation of the brand gives me no reason to believe that that will change.

He buys all Sherwin Williams paint and swears by it so he got this for my husband to try on our barn. Every few years it seems, my husband is always having to scrape and repaint parts of it. You could tell just by the way this went on that it was a better quality paint/primer than everything we have used in the past. The coverage was really good and it went on easy. Was easy to clean the brushes and everything up afterwards too. It is a bit more expensive than what my husband normally used but as the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\".

My home turned out wonderful.  The paint was mixed to exactly the color I wanted.  The true test of the paint I believe is the weather.  I painted my home early  August, and it's now December. No runs/bleeding through, it still looks like I painted it yesterday.I was very happy with the Paint.  I had started to paint the inside now, and yes, I went back to get Sherwin-Williams Interior Paint.  So far things look great, excellent coverage.Oh, I did start the inside with a cheap paint, and halfway through I decided to change and not use it because it was clumping.
