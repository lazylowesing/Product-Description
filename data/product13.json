            "text": "We bought 130 bags of this black mulch and it's complete garbage. There's nothing premium about this mulch, except the price. Here's what we found in our \"premium\" mulch- fungus, plastic, fiberboard, painted wood, rocks, rusty nails, and other debris. Need parts for a Nerf gun? We got it. Need rocks to go with your mulch? We got it! Need painted wood? Sure, we've got it. What about un-dyed pieces of scrap? You guessed it, we got that too!Thinking about buying this product? Well, I hope you've had your tetanus shot! I found plenty of rusty nails that could have sent me to urgent care. I laid all the mulch down by hand and it was like handling hazmat. I don't know how they can sell this junk legally? It's like they didn't care what they shredded and sold. I had one weekend to get all my mulch down with the weather and I took my chances with this product. Although I read bad reviews, I thought these were isolated cases. After laying down 130 bags, sourced from varying pallets, I learned my lesson the hard way. It wasn't a one-off experience. This product is just plain filthy junk. *Please view the pictures of some of my finds.",

A few months ago, against my better judgment I purchased about 25 more bags for the flower bed. It looks good until that one time when you perhaps pull a weed or do whatever to turn the mulch over. I was extremely disappointed when AGAIN, I see white mold and mildew. Sure, it cant be seen from the road, but when you get up close, a few feet away, you can see where everything under the first layer has turned white with mold and mildew. This mulch is in a couple different locations. Front of the house where there sun all day, and around the corner where there is sun most of the day, or morning and early afternoon. What I had purchased last year also had turned white. Actually I should have known better when I saw it in the bag. Yes, black mulch and red, had white mold in the bag. I thought it was something that would come off but it doesn't. Do yourself a favor if you really want a nice looking flower bed. Purchased something that is guaranteed not to mold or mildew.

Hoping for the best, we spread it out . Can't tell the difference from what we put out a year and a half ago. And seems to still be losing color. BIG, big disappointment!! Would like to get our money back or at least be given bags that have color.

But it is WAY worse than that. Some of the 40-50 bags I bought had mold - a small amount immediately obvious. I knew it was the mulch because I had a couple bags left over and later opened them to find raging mold) I soon had a blanket of white-yellow mold covering the entire front & back yard landscaping.Plants died, flowers didn't bloom, and fruit production was scarce. It took a TON of time and back breaking work to scrape that gooey stuff from my entire property. I then had to treat the soil, plants, etc. It took months. EXPENSIVE!! I still have to get new ground cover and apply it. My yard has looked like crap for a long time. I work really hard to have a nice yard I can enjoy ... all for nothing. They should call this stuff \"Mold by the Bag\".",

            "text": "I actually read the reviews as I was waiting in line to pay for some, so I thought I'd just get 5 bags to see if they're OK or not before buying any more. It's on sale so at $2 a bag how could I go wrong?\n\nThe first 5 were all OK, pretty fine and uniform, with no scrap lumber, big chunks, termites, dead animals or wet dripping messes as some have reported.\n\nJust plain old mulch which looks good to me and spread like any mulch did before. So my 15 bags were all good to go, seem high quality to me. Whether the brown stays a year as they guarantee, we'll see.\n\nI suspect a lot of problems reported are due to storage issues at the store or manufacturer, outside in the rain or for periods of time which allows water or insects to get into the bags. The bags I loaded into my car were on pallets, wrapped in plastic, which could only help to protect the mulch.\n\nI'd say more but what more can you say about mulch?",

            "text": "We ordered 2 pallets of mulch for our entire front yard in black initially.  Based on reviews, the black faded to a \"dark brown\" color.  However, when we laid one bag of black on the ground, it was BLACK!  It looked like it was burnt, and living in California, we did not want our front yard to look like it had been on fire.  So we exchanged the black for the brown and we couldn't be happier with the result.  After drying, the color fades from having a slight red/purple tone to a nice pure brown color.  Lowe's was great to work with as far as the exchange process went.  At $2.00 a bag when you catch it on sale, and the ability to have it delivered, it's a great deal!  Other reviews had stated they found a lot of debris in their mulch.  Out of 130 bags, I found one bent nail in one bag.",

While it did look nice for the first week or so ~~~~~ we then noticed disgusting fungus looking GROWTHS and pine tree saplings popping up everywhere. Upon much research we learned that this was Slime Mold, which was luckily non-toxic to humans and pets. Now we are faced with these disgusting BLOBS and pulling saplings on a daily basis. I am now also noticing the Slime Mold encroaching on my plantings AND lawn.

I was right and all the nay sayers who said yuck loved it. My neigherbors even stopped over to tell me how awesome it all looked once I rescaped the design, planted and layed the mulch. The last few owners did nothing to the landscape over several years so this house was a eyesore to the neighbors and the different appearance the black mulch gave the front, side and back of my home was very appealing and applaudable. I am excited this is $2 a bag. I did not get this on sale last year, missed the sale 2x, but this year, I am doubling up on what I bought last year to ensure a rich and appealing look. The black faded al ittle but like someone else said, wet it and keep it moist if you're in a dry area and it will almost refresh/renew itself. I am in MI so we have sporatic weather from hot to cold to wet to hot and humid and the mulch still looked great last fall. Just deciding to clean out the old before I lay the new or just pile it up and over it is the biggest dilemma but I am getting this stuff today and laying it out tomorrow. It's been a long winter and I need the green to look green and the purples, pinks and white plants to look vibrant to make my house look as good as Marth Stewart if not better!",

I'm not sure I will buy this again, maybe 2 bags at a time to test it first, definitely not 30 again.",

All the mulch had good color and was shredded similarly to the Scott's shredded mulch (which is more then double the price for .5 cu/yd less).  No garbage in any of the bags or mold. I expect the color to fade but didn't listen to older review stating to put it down when there is no rain in forecast for at least 48-72 hours so will see if that helps. Compares identically to Scott's Earthgro mulch. Can't beat the 5 for $10 deal!",

Look at the color of the bags; one is a darker (Chocolate) color than the other one (Reddish) and so are the mulches. If you need to spruce up your mulch or spreading mulch, verify the colors first. Make sure you get the same color, unless you are going for a mixed look. Some employees know of the problem and others do not. The employee that was helping customers said they were not different and you need to get bags from the same pallet. I understand dye colors may change from different batches, but the bag color being different? They should be separated, since one is a dark brown and the other is lighter.",

This procedure really keeps the weeds down.  I used 60 bags last year, and just bought another 60 bags this week.  13.5 bags equal a cubic yard.  So $27.00/ cubic yard.

            "text": "For the past couple of years, i purchased vigoro black hardwood mulch from a Lowe's competitor. Very chunky, uneven color and faded quickly. This year, i purchased triple processed mulch from a local nursery at $4.99/bag. Beautiful, spread well and my front yard beds looks fantastic. Back yard, another story. Since Lowe's was offering their premium mulch for $2/bag I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mulch I purchased! Nearly the same as the Scotts brand that i purchased for more than double at another competitor. I will definitely use Lowe's premium mulch next year for all of my beds. Great product, greater value.",

We've always used shredded cypress in flower beds away from buildings (rock by buildings). But the environmentalists say that is not a good idea. Mature cypress trees are just not available anymore. So we looked for brown hardwood mulch. Bought a test bag and looked inside. We came back and bought 40 bags for our perennial beds. No trash, not shredded but well chopped, only a couple instances of small amount of white mold. We probably only removed 5-10 larger palm-sized wood chunks and a couple rocks. This mulch was exactly what we wanted. Good color, hope it lasts. Purchased in Sioux Falls, SD. (And at $2 per bag it's hard to beat)",

There is a huge difference in quality. I have one long flower bed that I started spreading mulch using the Scotts and then put out some of this brand just because it was the next bag handy in my 'supply' area. Night and day color and quality. Wow. Disappointing to say the least. Rich black mulch now paired with gray/ashy colored garbage. Thankfully I have a pallet of the better brand. The areas with this will just have to do until next Spring when the yard will need refreshed and I use a different kind. The other reviews mention garbage. I have found lots of odd, plastic pieces throughout. A bigger issue is that there is a white (paint like) substance on a lot of it. I will attach a picture and hope it is clear enough to see the white as well as the general poor quality (Hershey wrapper). Imagine if you spilled white paint on your black mulch and then stirred it up a little. It's very obvious to see and makes the product all the more disappointing. Next year I will pay the extra $1 or so a bag to get a better quality.",

            "text": "This was my first purchase of black mulch. I normally use cypress mulch. This product is hardly mulch. The contents of the bags included rocks, large blocks of wood, chunks of random wood, plastic, wire, foil, nails, cardboard, recycle brown bags, and a little little little amount of true mulch. Oh and several bags were moldy. I am so disappointed that Lowes would buy this GARBAGE that seems like it was pulled from someones recycle day curb, put in a vat of black paint, and put in a bag labeled \"mulch\". I can't wait for next spring to see how much of this garbage has broken down into the earth....stay tuned....and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",

The bags I bought 2 half weeks ago looked good in the bag until I laid all 25 bags and the next day. I looked after the mulch had dried out and the color looked much more faded as what I have left from a year ago. So I'm very disappointed. These bags were on sale for $2.00 a bag so the price was great but the color is very unsatisfactory. I always buy things at Lowes, but I'm not happy about my latest mulch purchase. I'm adding 2 pictures, the first is the mulch I laid last May 2015 and the second pic is what I just bought and laid 2 half weeks ago May 10, 2016 . I would return the mulch, but i have already laid all of the bags. You can see quite a difference.",

The second was from a different, but similar store. I was happy to find this at Lowe's because it's closer to my home and the price was great, about 4 bags for under $10.When I distributed the mulch in my flower bed, I discovered a lot of garbage. Plastic caps, a lock nuts, a piece of 2x6, a rock, shreds of plastic bags. They certainly didn't screen this well, or the 2x6 would have gotten screened out. The quality control over what goes into this stuff is horrible, and it makes me wonder if I've just distributed a bunch of shredded pressure treated wood into my bed - which would fill it with the chemicals used to preserve wood.Besides pouring garbage into my flower bed - even the chunks of wood were poorly sized. What I've purchased before was mulch that was made of relatively similar sizes of wood chips. This had a lot of big chunks that leaves the flower bed looking uneven. I ended up taking those large chunks and putting them behind the irises because they looked so bad. There are a couple in the picture above the plastic and 2x6.The bag says \"Contains natural forest products\" but it also contains a lot of junk.",

Folks, this is mulch. Pretty much how you have always known mulch. Yes, you could spend more and get a better quality.

I had purchased a number of bags of Scotts Premium Brown Mulch from Home Depot, but they were out of this mulch and I figured the Lowes product would at least be comparable.It is anything but--It's awful. First, it is more like chipped or shredded wood chunks that have been artificially colored a very dark brown (almost grey quite frankly when coming out of the bag). Second, I agree with others about the color degrading quickly. After just one decent rain the \"brown\" color has mostly disappeared and what I am left with is a pile of grey wood chips--very unappealing.I have attached an image I just took a few minutes ago. On the top is the Scotts Brown Mulch, on the bottom is the Lowes brown (looks like grey now) mulch. The Scotts mulch has been down for weeks, the Lowes mulch for less than a week. I picture says it all. Very disappointed.This is the first time I have been extremely disappointed in any product sold at Lowes. I will not purchase this again and advise anyone else looking for high quality mulch to consider the Scotts Premium mulch, which is true mulch and that color does indeed last for well over one full year.",

And, it gets even better... when you put water on it, the color runs off, I've never seen anything like it!

The rich brown color had faded to splotchy light brown with flecks of white from where the dye had washed off in the rain. I prefer buying my mulch in bags as it's easier to place them where needed using our lawn tractor and trailer; however, I will not make the mistake of buying this product in the future.

The managers were kind enough to give us a free, high quality termite treatment kit, to treat the area around our home. Lowes' genuine concern and exceptional customer service were a big relief when having to deal with the aftermath of termite infested mulch.Please do keep buying from Lowes; their customer service is superb.

A family member bought the red sale priced mulch at Home Depot and had much, much better results. I think I'll use their brand in the future. BTW our mulch was purchased in the Toledo area.",

Here in Dallas, the color was bleached out in a matter of 3 months, just a heads up in hot sunny climates. The second issue was the abundance of termites (those the store did exchange) the last issue was the huge chunks of bark and can best be described and thick cut off branches. I wish that there were more positives other than we purchased on sale. I will not be purchasing this brand again. YMMV",

That new batch was different. The color was light brown, instead of dark, and not much of it was shredded. Instead the bags contained mostly large chips of wood, which can not be called mulch. Either Lowes uses more than one supplier for their mulch or a single supplier that has bad quality control.

The color of mulch is a dark brown, browner than most brown mulches. I thought it was good mulch until I noticed how large the pieces were. They were similar to large chunks of wood more so than mulch. Some pieces were parts of a small tree trunk or branch cut about 4 - 5\" in length. Also found large rocks in a few bags of mulch. One rock was the size of a softball. I waited to do this review until I purchased some more mulch produced by Scotts and sold by Home Depot. This mulch was much better quality, no large chunks and the color was closer to the mulch that I get from wholesalers. This mulch was on sale for the same cost 4 for $10.I wouldn't go so far as to recommend not purchasing the Lowe's mulch, because mulch is seasonal and regional. The lot that I got may have been a bad lot but in the future I will be more cautious purchasing this brand and lean more toward the Scotts Brand.",

I have found three small bits of random plastic, but no construction debris or insects.  This mulch is probably as clean as any of the other mulch brands I've used over the years.There are a lot of negative reviews, so it must be that quality depends a lot on the supplier of the moment.

Black Hardwood Mulch\" for $2 a bag.  This sale price plus the 5% discount by using my Lowe's card was within my price point.  I purchased the mulch at my local Lowe's Store. The staff at the store even loaded my car! I unloaded the bags at my house early afternoon and was able to open and spread out the mulch about 28 hours later (next day). The first bag that I opened had a white mold-like substance on the mulch (see first photo).  Out of the 20 bags that I purchased, about 15 had a significant amount of white mold-like growth on the mulch.  I did use the mulch and, after a bit of raking, covered up most of the white (keep in mind I purchased the Black colored mulch, so the white was clearly visible). In the end, the mulch looks ok and other than me breathing in the mold while spreading (next time I will use a mask) the condition of the mulch was not so horrid that I felt compelled to try to return the mulch or otherwise complain to the local store. I did read the online reviews before purchasing this product and there were comments about a mold-like condition of the mulch. So, my point of this lengthy comment is for the buyers to know what they are getting when they: (1) make a purchase at the end of the season (I assume these bags had been sitting outside, and in my case, in the humid Southeast) in the Lawn and Garden department since Spring, (2) the item is deeply discounted and (3) the reviews indicate a possible issue.",

            "text": "I recently purchased a new home and I have a ton of areas to mulch. I started purchasing bags of this mulch due to the cost and the ease of just dropping bags as needed at trees or the shrubs surrounding the house. First thing is these bags generally are drippy with the brown dye coming out. They are stored outside in the garden area so if it rains, these bags get wet and the mulch soaks up the water for a while. So be mindful that you may make a mess of your trunk and self. The dye for the most part washed out of my shirts but my jeans are all stained. And not too shockingly, when the bags are wet, the stink. The color out of the bag is great but it fades quickly, I've had some down for two weeks and through three rain storms. I don't think the brown will last through the summer but we shall see.",

It was WAY too expensive, so I went to WalMart and bought black mulch for LESS than $20/bag ... their regular price.  BUT, the less expensive mulch was not shredded as well and had large chunks as well as long and sharp pieces that poked thru most of the bags.  Decided to buy only about 40 bags and wait ... with hope ... for Lowes to reduce the price again.  Now that they have, we intend to buy at least another 50 or more bags.

This is done to improve the overall appearance of a business and your home is no exception.Lowes put this mulch on sale for Memorial weekend, its a real bargain at 44% off the normal price. This makes the product a real value for a new area requiring several bags. This Brown Hardwood Mulch was purchased to use around vegetable plants to conserve moisture and reduce nematodes from soil splashing up on the foliage during rainfall. The small vegetable garden in my yard looks great with a layer of fresh mulch and I am pleased with this product. The plants were also purchased from Lowes.This mulch was rated 4 Stars because some of the wood was somewhat coarsely chopped with a few large chunks of wood, some of it was finely peeled wood.

I was prepared to be completely disappointed and decided to only buy a few bags to try it out.  Wellâ¦. I ended up buying 12 bags (looked pretty good in the bag) and EVERY bag I opened was darn near perfect.  The debris was really minimal, no mold and the mulch was pretty consistent in size and color (Brown).  I was pretty darn happy.  This stuff is great!  I may not be a mulch âconcessionerâ but it looks like regular mulch to me.  Spent $26 (there is always tax!!) on 12 bags and couldn't be happier.  I am actually going back to get more to do the remainder of the yard.  Now to be fair, there may be inconsistency in different regions.  Perhaps Colorado got the âcream of the cropâ.  Not sure, but based on the reviews I would have stayed clearâ¦VERY happy I didn't.  Now will it fade?  YEP!  Will it need to be replenished annually?  Absolutelyâ¦It's mulch folksâ¦and it's $2 for 2 cu ft. (that's a good sized bag).  It honestly looks just like what I had a landscaper put down a few years ago that cost much more!!

            "text": "I have used this product on a previous property with great results. The color was crisp and the quality was good and the best value. The black really makes the color of the plants pop and it looks fantastic. In November 2011, I decided to use it again on my new property and all new landscaping but unfortunately the product quality has deteriorated dramatically. The first batch of 100 bags I bought had an overwhelming amount of mold so much so that when the landscaper opened and poured out the bags, it fell out in chunks. About 40% of the mulch was affected and unusable. The color saturation between bags was so drastic that some bags were not black but more of a light brown.Fortunately Lowes in my area was extremely helpful and contacted the company to let them know of the issue and refunded part of my purchase. Thank you Lowes! Because I already have the black mulch down, I can't or don't want to switch to another color and in my area, this brand is the only one available in black. I needed to cover more area in my flower beds so reluctantly I bought another 40 bags. After opening 8 bags and finding bits and pieces of trash including hard plastic, paper, plastic bags among other things, I returned the rest to Lowes and again they were extremely helpful. However, this time I contacted the mulch company directly and spoke to someone responsible for managing the quality that came out of the Phoenix plant which is where this lot came from. She was very friendly and apologized but didn't really offer to help rectify the situation.By this time, you think I would have learned my lesson but I had some bare spots that needed coverage so I bought 4 more bags a month later. This time I looked at the bags very carefully before buying them and had to look through 20 bags before finding 4 that didn't contain mold or trash. I took the four bags home and after opening them, I found trash but not nearly as much. The color was good but I had to pick out all the pieces that had white paper stuck to the back of them. I just wish this company would get better quality controls in place because I love how the black mulch looks around my yard.",

Unfortunately, immediately after pouring the bag onto the flower bed to spread/apply it around my shrubs/perennials I began to notice small white particles all over it. My husband thought perhaps it was possibly a bad batch/bag so he opened another only to find more of these tiny white particles all over it and in some cases there were large clumps of it. He drove back to Lowes and asked several Garden Ctr employees to look at it only for them to say that it's probably mold or fungus. So I decide to log on to Lowes to ck reviews and read where someone said there's was covered in termites. Needless to say all but the 2 bags thrown in our flower bed have been returned, but we're VERY concerned about our shrubs/plants because we just bought/planted all new shrubs and amended the organic soil we installed last year. It's been a huge investment of money literally in the ground, not to mention our time so I would literally be devasted if this mulch was infested with mold or termites. The thought just makes me ill. So buyer PLEASE beware. It's just too bad bc no one locally has a very dark brown mulch.",

I find this \"mulch\" to be nothing more but chopped up dyed wood (my opinion).If the manufacturer's name is on the bag, it's in a foreign language... What I see, I can't pronounce.Today, doing yard work in the front yard, I noticed various plants that have their shoots turning brown, plants that I've had for years.... plants that normally thrive and reproduce with no effort on the homeowners part, plants that were transplanted from poolside of a former home to this with no fear of damage... and thrive they did at this present location for the past 20 years, and this pertains to seven or eight identical plants.Whether this mulch is killing the plants or simply discoloring them... At the present time, I do not know.Obviously something is wrong with the plants (all of them) and the only common denominator is this chopped up wood brown mulch of which I'll be tearing up shortly as yard debris pickup. Has anyone else encountered problems with their plants since using this Brown Mulch?",

The issue here is that this product is more pulp wood than regular mulch. The mulch I have purchased in the past is double ground and is easy to spread. This mulch has way too much unground wood to called mulch. There are chunks of wood in some cases 6 to 7 in. long. After a light rain all you see are the unground pieces that are left. What mulch that was there is gone, mostly. But now I have learned another old lesson, you get what you pay for. So next time I will look for another source. I would not recommend the product.",

Other reviewer's said that they found huge chunks of wood, door knobs, soda cans, and everything including the kitchen sink in their mulch. All I can say is that my 5 bags of mulch have been shredded to a uniform consistency, as they should be with no surprises.

Started to put down the mulch I bought on sale - looked lovely 3 bags in until I started seeing a bunch of termites all over before they burrowed back under the newly put down mulch!!!!!!!! Seriously the worst feeling in the world and super scary- had to run to buy termite killer/ spray, but with the on/ off rain wondering in the back of my head if I killed them or not. :(  Will never buy this brand again sale or no sale!!!!",

With a layer of weed cloth and a thick layer of mulch, weeds don't stand a chance. Ones that do pop up, you just easily pull them out. It does a great job at keeping me from doing the yearly Spring \"weeding\". When ever it goes on sale, I stock up knowing I will use it. The more I mulch, the happier the garden is, the less water I use, the less working I do, leaving me more time for fishing... It does the job of conserving water and keeping the roots cool from the Summer heat. You must use weed cloth underneath this mulch or you are just wasting your time because the weeds WILL grow in the mulch...",

Speaking only as one who made his own mulch, most people don't understand that it takes a lot of effort and time to create the equivalent of 10 bags of mulch. Therefore, the price, particularly, when on sale, is an excellent value. I have found trash in my bags, but only sporadically, and I remove it. Sure, there are some big pieces, but big deal. Remove them or put them in the back. I have bought the brown bag mulch from Lowe's for the last 10 years and will continue to buy from them. I have made my own mulch, and buying it from Lowe's it so much easier with little effort involved. They will even load it in your car/truck for you.

            "text": "Read a ton of \"not so good\" reviews before making a decision on this mulch and due to such, was very hesitant to purchase the Premium Mulch - Brown color.Went to my local Lowe's store to view it personally in the bags. There were a couple of bags torn open on the stack / pallet so I could actually see close up what I was thinking about buying. I did not see any type of bugs, termites, big hunks of bark, cow manure or any other additives within the bags, just brown mulch as was reported / mentioned in some of the reviews, so thought that was a good thing. I also actually smelt the mulch up close to see if any mildew odor or any odor present for that matter. What I did smell was a fresh, woody type smell, almost cedar smell which one would think that is a good thing since it is a wood product. After an extensive look, smell, etc of the open bagged mulch, I purchased 12 bags which Lowe's loaded in my vehicle for me as they are pretty heavy, but this mulch had no water in the bags or leaks at all. Once back home, it was spread out in my landscaping and it looked really nice and refreshed, almost like a professional just did the job but not because I did it, the product just simply made a world of difference to the curb appeal of the home and I was very pleased with the outcome!Although some bags at some locations/states may differ and would relate those reviews to that reason; the ones I bought were right on the money and a great price during Labor Day holiday sales in central S.C.I would recommend this particular mulch for sure, but as always, look #and smell#..before you buy it and you shouldn't go wrong at all!",

The shredding is not 100% uniform through the bags and you get variations from larger pieces to more finely shredded.

My preference would be the rubber mulch, but after putting 230 bags of it around the house, my budget was a little tight. So far I have put out about 100 bags of this mulch, and it looks pretty good (dark brown color). I still have about 50 more bags to go, and will wait for it to go on sale again before buying more. One thing I have noticed is that critters do not like to scrounge in the rubber mulch as much as the natural kind. Maybe the smell has something to do with it. All in all, I can say it has met expectations. I can recommend. And, one thing I always do before mowing, is to go around all the flower beds and rake any mulch that has spilled out, natural and rubber, back up in the beds. You have to try to keep from blowing it away when mowing. Maybe a little OCD here.....",

Several bags were nearly black and so far off from the brown that I had to buy more to cover it so it would look uniform. I'm pretty disappointed but couldn't go buy all new mulch to replace this.",

In the past, the mulch was nicely ground, albeit the dye does leach out when the bags are wet. I got some bags early this spring - most likely leftover stock - and it was fine. However, with my recent purchase, I was very disappointed. Like a previous reveiwer stated, this mulch was not Premium! It had large pieces and chunks of wood and didn't spread very far. I even found a long piece of twisted copper wire in one bag! I suspect Lowe's changed their supplier, but not the bag labeling as Premium mulch. A good value still if you don't mind having to buy extra bags to get the coverage you want.",

At least 1, maybe 2 bags were a slightly darker color-I figure it will all even out eventually. It did have a bit of an odor, but not super strong or anything. If you're not too picky, I think it's worth getting, especially if you are using it in a new area to build up the depth. Still need quite a bit more and will buy this again if nothing else to keep it consistent, but may buy nicer stuff to top off after a year or two.",

Here are my findings after reading a bunch of the reviews on this page and the big orange page. Went to the big orange store. Went to Lowes. Couldn't see inside the big orange store's bags, so assumed they were full of all the stuff described in the reviews: trash, tree trunks, car tires and maybe a sleeping landscaper that got scooped up. Left and went to Lowe's. Their bags were clear and filled top to bottom with black mulch. I thought, at the price of 5 for $10 how could i lose. I put them in my car and there were no stains on my clothes and nothing spilling out staining my car interior. I got them home and spread them all 7 days ago. The mulch still looks as black as the day I purchased it. There was not one shred of garbage or sleeping landscapers that got scooped up.My takeaway... Go look for yourself and believe your eyes. Lowes $2 product in a clear bag is excellent for a year's beauty. What more can you ask?",

Here are my findings after reading a bunch of the reviews on this page and the big orange page. Went to the big orange store. Went to Lowes. Couldn't see inside the big orange store's bags, so assumed they were full of all the stuff described in the reviews: trash, tree trunks, car tires and maybe a sleeping landscaper that got scooped up. Left and went to Lowe's. Their bags were clear and filled top to bottom with black mulch. I thought, at the price of 5 for $10 how could i lose. I put them in my car and there were no stains on my clothes and nothing spilling out staining my car interior. I got them home and spread them all 7 days ago. The mulch still looks as black as the day I purchased it. There was not one shred of garbage or sleeping landscapers that got scooped up.My takeaway... Go look for yourself and believe your eyes. Lowes $2 product in a clear bag is excellent for a year's beauty. What more can you ask?",

We still had the bags from last year, so I know I didn't buy a different brand or kind. Within a couple hours of laying down the mulch, they turned a dark brown color as they were airing out. My husband and neighbor commented on the dark brown color as well. I bought black and it was a rich black color coming out of the bag. There was no rain.

I hate that some bag has powdery spots on the mulch, some kind of bacteria infection or fungus activity, even though appears to be harmless after you spread them out in the sun. Some bag is absolutely perfect with no issue. Nice-sized chunky mulch which will last much longer than the shredded mulch. The picture is misleading because these are not shredded mulch. The mulch is actually chunky in size, big chunky wood pieces, which last longer than the shredded ones anyway. Nice color, it faded a few days after you spread them, but the color stays the same after the first initial fading, so it's all good anyway. I would buy them again, but I do not want to happen to grab the bag with white powdery spots on them. Wish me luck.",

Both mulches seemed fine, quality-wise -- I did NOT experience any of the concerns others have expressed here, e.g., mold, debris, bugs, etc. HOWEVER, I do NOT personally like the appearance of either color mulch. Mind you, this is totally a matter of personal preference (and, as I said, I wanted to experiment).If I had to do it again, I would have tried each color in a limited (perhaps, little-seen) area first. I shall be returning to the FloriMulch Melaleuca that I've been using since I moved here 3 years ago, as I prefer its color, texture, etc. BUT, again, this is not a critique of the quality of this mulch, just a personal preference.

This had me on alert. So I kept an eye out while spreading my next 25 bags that I just picked up. Well the third bag I open has terimites living in the mulch. First I noticed a lot of bugs in the pile of mulch so I looked closer. This is when I noticed the white termites, finding more as I sifted through the rest of that pile of mulch from that bag. Now this is the only one is noticed termites in but that's not to say there weren't in any of the others. So now I'm going to have to figure out which chemical I'm going to have to use to treat all this mulch with. My coworker ended up shovel up all her mulch into garbage bags and throwing it out but she didn't have 80 bags worth.",

I have been using bagged mulch for the last 5 years for convenience fully expecting the mulch to not be the same quality as triple ground mulch I used to purchase in bulk. I have purchased mulch from Lowe's and their major competitor. The quality was at best 3 stars with the competitor's Scott's brand maybe slightly better but not significantly. My biggest complaint was the large pieces and trash in the mulch.  I purchased 5 bags from Lowe's earlier in the season for a small job and was pleasantly surprised by the improved quality and color of the mulch. So much so that I wondered if I picked up the wrong mulch.  When it went on sale, I ordered 150 bags delivered on pallets and shrink wrapped and placed on my driveway for a reasonable fee.  I just put down the mulch this week and all 150 bags were outstanding.  The mulch was as good as any 3 times ground bulk mulch I've bought and free of any large pieces or debris.  I don't know if Lowe's listened to the negative reviews and upped the quality and/or changed suppliers.  Whatever the reason, kudos to Lowe's for a much improved product at a great price!

The mulch was pretty close in appearance to what is displayed on the plastic packaging, which is to say mostly 1.5 - 3\" flat-pieces, brown stained, hardwood chips. The stain did turn my nitrile gloves brown since I spread a fair amount of it by hand, although I can easily believe it will stay mostly brown for the entire growing season. I found it amusing that the brown bags received only a 2 star rating on this Lowes site, while the red bags received a much higher rating, since I suspect the manufacturer uses the same process for both and only varies the dye they spray on the wood. Probably says more about the reviewers than the product. While I prefer the shredded mulch from another vendor because it has smaller pieces, that brand had massive amounts of little splinters which made working with it by hand a pain, literally. This product, from the bags I received here in San Diego, was clean (no cactus, palm fronds, municipal waste, etc.) flat wood chips. Also, I grew up on a tree farm in NH, so it was nice to see that these chips really were hardwood, which means they won't break down quite as fast as the softwood mulches do.",

I've been using it in my front yard for the past four years and I've never found anything objectionable, except for a bit of white fungus inside a bag that was left wet (once dried out and exposed to air, the fungus went away). Usually, I get clear bags that are dry or that have been stored with protection from the elements. I'm guessing if you buy a large quantity (I only get 6-10 cu ft), you're getting stuff brought in from a warehouse instead of what they display in-store. So I guess my advice is buy bags that you've inspected in the store; if you need a larger quantity shipped, use another source. As for color, this does fade to gray after a few months, but that's part of the natural process of organic material breaking down. If you want something that will keep its color, use rubber.",

Subterranean termites in some bags.  Some soaked with water, very heavy to handle while other bags were dry. White string mold in some bags. Rocks, plastic bag scraps, wood pieces with blue paint on them. The color fades quickly unlike the very durable colored mulch that Lowe's used to sell for several years. Very disappointed. I always promote Lowe's over the orange box and the place with the helpful hardware man. I'm doing a job this weekend and I'll look carefully at the Lowe's garbage mulch first, I suspect I'll buy across the street where Vigoro is the same price.",

Previously the biggest complaint would be that the color and texture didn't match from batch to batch but that was easy enough to determine by looking at the bag. What you can't see if the amount of trash in these bags. Previous years I would find an occasional piece of plastic but nothing terrible, this year I was constantly finding nails, crushed aluminum, green metal straps, plastic etc. It wasn't uncommon to find more than I could hold in my hands per bag and I have big hands. So while these are easier to move around than the bulk delivery method I lost all that time to picking through my flower beds to pull this garbage out. Not to mention I am now worried I may have missed a nail and someone might step on it. The final straw for me was that several bags had mold growing inside. When I flipped the bag over the entire bottom was mold, so they got dumped in the woods. Guess I will be trying the HD version for my remaining 50+ bags.\n\nBut with that said my buddy just said the 50 bags he got were relatively clean so maybe this is batch dependent. Either way I think I will try something different.",

Absolutely impressed with it.This year, however, i bought an additional 25-30 bags total. I have made several trips, because I have never mulched this particular area of my yard, and it is a very large area. Each trip I opened bags that were different than the last. EVERY bag was different and each purchase I make it becomes more shredded than the last.I am now laying mutilated pieces of super white, molded bags, mixed with bags that are moistened nicely with rich color (some are reddish looking and some are dark brown - NONE match each other!)So confused on how they actually make this product because of how significantly different each bag is. My recommendation is if you are simply adding curb appeal while selling your house like we are, it's worth it. If you genuinely care about your landscape and want to make your neighbors jealous, get something with better reviews!",

Not the case although it has got a little better after a day and I only hope that it disappears altogether over time as I have another order to pick up. I can't comment on color fade as yet although other reviewers have had this problem but it will be interesting to see how it compares to the Scott's I have in another area of of the yard which has not changed color in 12 months. I didn't come across any metal, nails etc as some other purchasers have, and no obvious signs of insects so far. Cheap price (5 bags for $10) but I would not call this premium mulch by any stretch of the imagination.",

Of course no one is available to help senior citizens load.  I loaded over 20 bags myself even though I am 72 years old.  I also had to help a man who was 86, an elderly woman and another elderly man.  When I picked some up last week and asked for help I was told no one is available even though there are people in the store.  If the mulch was taken care of it wouldn't been a problem.  It's tough to spread mulch that is in wet chunks and dripping with water.  Lowes calls it premium mulch which when dry is nice if you ignore the white mold and a few rocks.

            "text": "I purchased 20 bags of Lowe's Premium Black Mulch on 6/27/17.  It is the w-o-r-s-t mulch I have ever used.  Each bag contained an abundance of BLUE mulch chips and there were cut up wire, like electrical wire, throughout the mulch.  Since I had purchased 20 bags I was not interested in having to load it back up in my car to return, so I went ahead and put it all down and I needed to finish my landscape project at that time.  I might add that another reason I would not have loaded it back in to my car to return is because when I bought it the bags were all wet.  Lowe's employees did help load it in to my car, but were very careless.  Upon returning home and removing the mulch from my car, there were a number of spots on the ceiling and interior of my car where the wet mulch had come in to contact and left black stains.  Now, only a little over a month later, the mulch has lost all of it's color - and there are even chips that are blond colored so all the mulch looks \"freckled,\" and definitely NOT black even though the color is supposed to last for 12 months.   PLUS, as the mulch has gotten wet and faded, it has \"bled\" on to my shrubs and plants and most of them are either dead or dying from the dyes in the mulch.   I would like to contact Lowe's to learn how to at least get a refund on this really nasty product.  Thanks.",

There have been no color bleed, very, very, little debris in bags which is a huge plus of locally procured products and has dramatically improved the appearance of gardens and foundation beds.

While I understand that this product was on sale, I by no means thought it was going to be up to the quality of our local hometown store, but had I know the garbage I was going to have to pick out of if I never would have wasted money on 28 bags. When I say I picked garbage out of this mulch I mean exactly ghost. Ever single bag had a variety of garbage in it that I had to pick out. The garbage included garbage bag pieces, random pieces of plastic ranging from 1\" to about 5\" across, twisty ties, a large piece of frayed rope about 6\" long, random pieces of metal, and my favorite part, a large piece of a Red Bull can, large enough I could still read what it was. I can't believe a company like this would put this awful excuse for \"premium mulch\" out on their floor. Oh and did I mention the smell? Yep, it smelled completely like manure, not at all like mulch.

I did not see any color variation or bleeding issues other people talked about which is about the only positive (thought it was dry and did not rain for a while after putting it out).  However I did notice several issues.  First, the mulch is more like bark chips and is very light, it floats out of the beds all throughout the lawn very easily.  Second, it does not break down, the mulch and pieces don't look much different today than when it was spread.  Third, there was a lot of trash in the bags, metal and plastic it looked like.  This stuff was ok for what I needed which was a lot of bags cheap to make new beds, but here on out, I'll be getting higher quality mulch to maintain the beds.",

I didn't have any mold issues or foreign substances (only 1-2 pieces of plastic - part of a garden hose?? in 30 bags). It will have to do for this season since I already put it down and don't feel like digging the bags out of the trash to argue a refund. But next year I will go for a bulk delivery from an actual garden supplier, the bagged stuff at the big-box stores seems to be going more downhill every year. It's a shame because the stuff I bought from Lowe's at the end of the year last year was really good, but it wasn't this brand or even the one they had advertised at the time. They must have run out and substituted it but it was a much better product, the remnants on the ground through the winter still looked better than this product that I just covered it with.",

I have used it for several years and this is my observation.  Occasionally a bag might have some really large pieces.  The dye will run so do not place bags on driveway/walkways etc. When you purchase, it is a good idea to get the dry bags. My husband picked up 20 bags after a couple days of rain. with my Honda Odyssey, and it drained all over the carpet and was a huge mess.  About bugs, Yes I did open one bag and found termites. That is one out of maybe 500 or so bags. If we leave the bags sitting too long and they have been wet, you may get white mold. Spread the mulch within a couple of weeks to avoid a lot of problems. Lowe's is wonderful to work with so if you find your bags are moldy or buggy let them know. I would assume they were not very fresh when you bought them. Oh yes, and when spread around our boxwood the tips of the leaves had a brownish red color, but it is pretty. Do not spread around food plants.",

He said he noticed it also and felt that the bags had been placed next to manure bags so they took on that earthy fragrance.  I had to drive home with all windows down and immediately removed them from my car.  I spread the mulch around several Arbor Vitae trees my husband planted earlier and still noticed the horrible smell! The trees are on the property line behind our home - -= about 75 feet behind the house.  As I was sitting at our dining room table with the back door open and could still smell that horrible odor!  I will be seeing someone at Lowe's to complaint.  I'm so glad I did not buy more bags and certainly will NOT be purchasing any more of this mulch from Lowe's or anywhere else.  Must do a sniff test before completing a purchase of much ----- who knew?  I always loved the fresh smell of mulch - but NO MORE!!!!",

Upon examination of the fine print on the bag, i discovered the distributer is the same exact one on the bag of the Walmart mulch which is sold for only $1.96 per bag. It is the same product in color and consistency. I don't mind the stick chunks, but I do mind the extra mark up for the same quality product. As the season goes on sometimes the mulch of the same product can change from March to say June. It's as if the person running the chipper or grinder is varying the size of the cuts. Or they are bagging the wrong product or mislabeling the product. This is why you see so many opened bags of mulch in the garden center. Now my mulch does not match the nice mulch I put down last year. Let the buyer beware!",

Once home in the dark didn't see the mood clearly, wife mentioned but I dismissed it as a good mulch would be treated for mold.  After laying it out noticed a lot of long, up to 8\" sticks mixed in as well as green plastic strips of what I can only describe as case strapping mixed in as well.  Horrible product unless you buy your \"premium\" mulch from a gas station. Too bad I installed this in the dark, otherwise I would have just went back and asked for a refund and this time demanded someone help me unload as no one came to help us load the vehicle with 15 bags of soaked heavy mulch.

No pieces more than 6\" long and only maybe 1-2 per bag that were even that long.Here's my advice: If you want it to look professional, hire a landscaper or spring for the name brand mulch.

A couple of days ago I found part of a rubber glove, cloth, pieces of wood that were painted blue (what do they use to make this junk), plastic, some mold, and other junk. I did take in some of the blue painted wood, for what it's worth. When I opened a bag this morning that had a very large amount of mold I was through. I am mid-70's with medical issues and have to do a lot of my yard work, heavy or not, because the lawn people charge by the neighborhood & I am unable to pay their  ridiculously high prices. I had to lift the bags back into my car to return them to the store, which was not at all easy, especially after working in heat and humidity. Not to mention a waste of my time and inability to complete work this morning, as well as gas to return this junk. I had a receipt for the 10 bags; however, since I sifted through and used 3 bags, threw out molded parts and junk, I was to only be reimbursed for the 7 bags. Thank God I had cancelled the extra 10 I purchased the next day because I was concerned that it was too much for me to do. Last year I returned several bags that were high content mold. This is what killed my beautiful peonies that I moved from my previous home. I recall seeing mold when applying the mulch, but for some dumb reason I thought the sun and heat would kill it. When I dug them up the roots were white with mold. Since that time, no plants have survived in that portion of my flower bed.After experiencing a couple of other other problems with Lowes, I have had it. It was bad enough having difficulty finding someone to help when in the store day or night, but to suffer aggravation, inconvenience and loss of time and money, I'm done!",

No bugs/termites, although I have purchased plants that were termite infested, not necessarily from Lowes. Quick fix was carpenter ant/termite killer solution in the hole prior to planting, problem solved, plant is doing fine no sign of termites. I have learned not to use wood mulch next to the house period. Because regardless of brand and even Cedar it eventually breaks down and it's like ringing the dinner bell. I use rubber mulches/stone next to the house and the wood for hedge rows, berms and beds farther away. Overall I am pleased with the product and would recommend.",

I could kick myself for not buying more when it was on sale, but I was a little concerned because I had always purchased the large bags 3 cu ft pine bark mulch that Lowe's sells as well. Love the look and is easy to spread. One thing I have noticed that makes it a better purchase than the pink bark mulch...it seems that it blocks unwanted weeds to a greater degree. Probably because it is more of a shredded wood and is more compacted when spread out in my flower beds. It may break down (decompose) faster in the soil than the pine bark mulch...that could be a good or not so good thing considering each individual's need, but for me, it's a plus. As far as which is better nutrient wise when it starts to decompose in the soil, I have no clue. I'm no expert...just love to watch my garden grow :-) P.S. Just a little tip for those who may not be aware. Don't spread your mulch right up to the stem of your plants. Keep it away 2-3 inches to let the roots of the plant breath and allow it to soak up more water.",

            "text": "My husband and I had been planning to shovel up the overgrown weeds, and 10+ year old River rock in front of our home for a while and recently began the process. With it being Mid Fall, I called several stores locally checking for brown mulch and one of the only places I could get it was Lowes. I placed an order for 15+ bags and picked them up over 2 trips as we only have a car. We both work and with it getting dark earlier and earlier, we work on the landscaping whenever we can, little by little. When we started the project I knew brown mulch would make the front of the house look so much nicer (especially compared to ridiculously overgrown weeds), and I couldn't be happier with the results. Now, I will say that this isn't the most expensive/high quality mulch that stores sell but mulch is mulch and it certainly does the job. As with most mulches, this mulch lost some of the darkness in the color after a few frosty mornings/rainy days, but it still looks fantastic! This mulch looks nice, and is affordable. If that doesn't sound good to you, I suggest getting a different brand! Otherwise, you cannot go wrong!",

            "text": "I usually buy mulch in bulk from my local supplier of mulch, dirt, rock, etc. for my customers.  However, this customer only needed a small amount of mulch for two gardens which she added, so I bought 10 bags from Lowe's.  I was VERY disappointed when I applied this mulch.  The color is beautiful, but the chunks inside were embarrassing!  Many were 1\" x 3\", and there were many long (up to 8\") split pieces of wood.  Lots of random chunks that I had to remove.  This may be okay under trees in a large bed, but it certainly was not acceptable in a flower garden.  Very disappointed.  I have had bagged mulch before (from Lowe's and other places), but this is the worst I have ever seen.  By the way - after I drove 10 miles from the Lowe's store to deliver it, I wasn't going to take it back and buy it somewhere else.  Time is money.  I know they would cheerfully accept the return, but they aren't going to reimburse me for wasted wages and mileage. Just for the record - I spend LOTS of money at Lowe's and am almost always very happy with everything I buy there.  They should definitely not buy from this supplier, or at least require them to improve the quality.",

            "text": "I initially purchased this mulch because I was tired of shoveling bulk mulch from the back of my truck. Such exhausting work! On sale at $2.50 per bag, the Premier mulch was comparably priced to the bulk mulch I'd had delivered for years by the time I paid a $35 delivery fee. Having been disappointed by the quality and poor colorfastness of bagged mulch in the past, my expectations were low. Fortunately, they were exceeded! This mulch (and its color) lasted the guaranteed 12 months, which meant that when spring arrived this year, I could just \"top off\" previously mulched areas and beef up areas washed out by rain and scuffed out by our dogs. Also, because the mulch from the previous spring was still largely intact, the early spring weeds were dramatically reduced. Now I buy this mulch even if it's not on sale! (Though with having to buy about 75 bags, I do try to time my purchase for their spring sale!)",

I bought this after a competitor ran out of their $2 product, so it's not just a cheap-mulch issue. The mulch I put down 2 weeks ago from the competitor still looks awesome.In short, I'm taking the 18 bags I haven't put down back to Lowes, after seeing what last night's two-inch rainfall did to the color. The product is a *mostly pleasing deep dark brown when you first apply it, but it fades immediately in spite of the \"12-month color guarantee\". I'll be reapplying another product over what I already put down - it's so bad that its' hard to tell where I stopped applying. Last year's color and this product are now virtually the same.*My other issue goes to consistency of the product. Not only are there big enough chunks to use for kindling, there are blue and red colored pieces throughout, evidently from the pallets used to make it. It was manageable to pick those out and toss them aside, again because they were plenty big enough to identify. Frustration is not due to money - it's the effort in applying and the rework. Why would you put a product out there that you know is going to waste peoples' time?",

            "text": "We, too, smelled the product through holes in the bag. It smelled a bit like the damp wood at a local theme water park...sort of dank, but mostly like a combination of mild dye smell and cedar.\n\nThe bags had many holes and it had rained recently. The employees were very nice and loaded them into the back of the tan interior minivan, offering sheet plastic to protect the bed of the vehicle before loading.\n\nOh, my! What a mess!!! We arrived home and found the brown dye had splattered half way up the side of the rear interior walls while it had been loaded. It was pooling and running under the plastic. Thankfully, we had left a thick protective blanket in place before the employee added the plastic, and the blanket absorbed most of the dye before it soaked through, as our travels were short in length. As we pulled the bags out of the vehicle, the dye got all over our arms and (work) clothes. It is a good thing we were dressed in work clothes to purchase the mulch, because the dye was running everywhere so quickly, we would have been hard pressed for time to go change, once we discovered all the problems! The vehicle smelled very strongly of dye at this point. It was all just an awful situation!\n\nWe stacked the bags on the grass, realizing the stain would probably stain the concrete driveway. We had to remove the plastic carefully, so that the rivulets of watery dye would not further seep under the poor attempt at protection. We then had to mop up the escaped dye with rolls of paper towels. Then, we had to wash and rewash all the interior surfaces and launder the old blanket. At this point, we wished we had not purchased this mulch, but return transportation became an apparent problem, and we were under a time constraint to apply the mulch.\n\nIf we thought the mulch transport was bad, we obviously had not applied the mulch, yet. We were COVERED in wet, smelly dye. It soaked through rubber overlay fabric gloves, soaked into our clothing, stained our arms and legs, and stained under our fingernails, which took two days to finally wash out the dye with repeated nail scrubs. It even slightly stained the shower surface, when we bathed at the end of the day, so now we had to clean the dye out of the shower! \n\nThe dye smelled awful, straight out of the bag, but dissipated fairly quickly. It stained the sidewalks and concrete everywhere we accidentally dropped it while applying it. (Those stains did wash off, but what a pain to have to stop and wash it as we went!) It stained the bottom of our shoes as we treaded lightly through larger beds, then tracked that onto the concrete and any surfaces on which we walked. We had to remove our shoes to enter the house for amenities during the course of our work, but our hands were so nasty, they got stain on the shoes and outdoor water faucets and tools. \n\nOf greatest concern is the now apparent realization that all this really offensive dye is going to leach into the ground around our house, into the water table, and, ultimately, possibly affect our family/pets/wildlife on a negative chemical scale. Of second concern is whether or not this dye is going to splash out onto the cement surfaces during rains. Our third concern is that the family/pets will not be able to step into the flowerbeds without tracking the damp or wet dye (or dry dye transferred from wet feet) onto the cement surfaces/interior house floors. Fourth concern is wondering what chemicals our bodies were exposed to while applying the mulch. And on a worldly, environmental scale, we are sorry we contributed to degradation of the natural environment caused by the production of massive volumes of this fake \"natural\" covering. \n\nThe mulch did not contain foreign debris, but we were a bit disappointed at how long and large some of the pieces were. Some were the size and shape of lasagna noodles!\n\nWe will not buy this, or any other, dyed mulch product again, and we will discourage others from purchasing it, as well.",

In a prior year, I recall getting a very bizarre yellow/orange mold during the summer (fuligo septica - aka dog vomit mold), but did not (at the time) identify the mulch as the source. This year, not only do I see some yellow/orange spores which appear to be the beginning of fuligo septica, but almost every bag has a whitish mold in about 5-20% of the total volume in the bag. In some places, the mold is so advanced that the mulch is densely clumping together and it's difficult to break up. When you put white mold in black mulch, the result is less than stellar - it barely looks like we added new mulch! Very disappointed, and I should have taken the bags back right away. I did not think it would be as bad as it really was, and frankly did not want the hassle of returning 35 bags. I will not be buying this brand of mulch again.",

            "text": "Last year I bought triple ground loose brown mulch from a local landscape supply.  I bought six yards which I picked up with my trailer.  Since Lowe's puts their sale price down to $2.00 per bag, that price on a per yard basis was somewhat cheaper then the landscape supply.  So I decided to give it a try since it looked OK in the bags and was \"premium\" mulch.  At 2 cu. ft. per bag, that's 13.5 bags per yard so I bought 80 bags (13.5 x 6 yds = 81).Handling the bags was no issue.  I could put three bags in my wheel barrow which would have been about the same amount if I had shoveled it loose.  As I started spreading the mulch, I was surprised and disappointed by two things about the mulch.  First of all, the consistency varied from bag to bag.  Some bags seemed to be ground pretty fine while others had fairly large chunks of un-ground wood.  Some of the chunks were as big as 1.5 inches in diameter and 3 inches long.  At best, I would consider this mulch to be \"double\" ground but with a premium designation I'd have expected it to be \"triple\" ground.Second, I found the color consistency to be very poor.  I picked up the bags in groups of 20 to 40 at a time.  Each time the bags were pulled from the same pallet.  However, the color of the mulch varied quite a bit.  Most bags were deep brown, but about every 3rd or 4th bag, I'd get one that was a redish brown color.  The difference is very noticeable.  One afternoon my wife came out and asked if I got the mulch from two different places because the color difference was so noticeable.Also, when I was about half done, I soon realized that 80 bags wasn't going to make it.  As such, I had to buy another 20 more bags.  Turns out that the landscape supply loads the loose mulch with a bucket loader.  Most often the bucket is one yard but they often are heaping buckets.  So you are typically getting about one and a quarter yards for each bucket.  So the 6 yards I got last year was probably more like 7.5 yards which is why I had to buy the extra 20 bags.Needless to say I won't be buying this mulch again next year.  I'll be going back to the landscape supply where the consistency of the color and grind are much better.",

            "text": "I have bought this mulch in the past, and purchased 35 bags this year during a sale. In a prior year, I recall getting a very bizarre yellow/orange mold during the summer (fuligo septica - aka dog vomit mold), but did not (at the time) identify the mulch as the source. This year, not only do I see some yellow/orange spores which appear to be the beginning of fuligo septica, but almost every bag has a whitish mold in about 5-20% of the total volume in the bag. In some places, the mold is so advanced that the mulch is densely clumping together and it's difficult to break up. When you put white mold in black mulch, the result is less than stellar - it barely looks like we added new mulch! Very disappointed, and I should have taken the bags back right away. I did not think it would be as bad as it really was, and frankly did not want the hassle of returning 35 bags. I will not be buying this brand of mulch again.",

            "text": "Last year I bought triple ground loose brown mulch from a local landscape supply.  I bought six yards which I picked up with my trailer.  Since Lowe's puts their sale price down to $2.00 per bag, that price on a per yard basis was somewhat cheaper then the landscape supply.  So I decided to give it a try since it looked OK in the bags and was \"premium\" mulch.  At 2 cu. ft. per bag, that's 13.5 bags per yard so I bought 80 bags (13.5 x 6 yds = 81).Handling the bags was no issue.  I could put three bags in my wheel barrow which would have been about the same amount if I had shoveled it loose.  As I started spreading the mulch, I was surprised and disappointed by two things about the mulch.  First of all, the consistency varied from bag to bag.  Some bags seemed to be ground pretty fine while others had fairly large chunks of un-ground wood.  Some of the chunks were as big as 1.5 inches in diameter and 3 inches long.  At best, I would consider this mulch to be \"double\" ground but with a premium designation I'd have expected it to be \"triple\" ground.Second, I found the color consistency to be very poor.  I picked up the bags in groups of 20 to 40 at a time.  Each time the bags were pulled from the same pallet.  However, the color of the mulch varied quite a bit.  Most bags were deep brown, but about every 3rd or 4th bag, I'd get one that was a redish brown color.  The difference is very noticeable.  One afternoon my wife came out and asked if I got the mulch from two different places because the color difference was so noticeable.Also, when I was about half done, I soon realized that 80 bags wasn't going to make it.  As such, I had to buy another 20 more bags.  Turns out that the landscape supply loads the loose mulch with a bucket loader.  Most often the bucket is one yard but they often are heaping buckets.  So you are typically getting about one and a quarter yards for each bucket.  So the 6 yards I got last year was probably more like 7.5 yards which is why I had to buy the extra 20 bags.Needless to say I won't be buying this mulch again next year.  I'll be going back to the landscape supply where the consistency of the color and grind are much better.",

I didn't notice them at first. I left the bags sitting in my pickup truck for a couple of weeks in my garage. Then after unloading them one day, I found a tick on me that evening. Since I've NEVER seen a single tick or flea in my yard, house or on any of my pets in the 20 years I've lived here, I couldn't figure out where it came from. Then I remembered unloading the mulch. The next morning I went out to inspect the bags and there were ticks crawling around on the inside as well as the outside in the seams of the bags and there were also a few in my truck bed. This is the first time I've seen any sort of insect in this mulch, and like I said... I've bought a lot of this stuff! Don't know where these last 10 bags came from but previous reviews have mentioned spider mites and termites so the manufacturer needs a heads-up on pest control in their facility.

I have bought 105 bags, so far this year and have found no metal, no plastic, etc. Yes in the bag it is a richer black, but only because its so moist. I see no additional color variation after the initial 10 minute drying period then I have 2 months after hard Western PA rains. Yes, your hands will be black from spreading it, but the product is damp in the bags. I have had zero mold in any of my bags either. The sizes are all quite uniform and I have not had any 8 inch pieces, etc. Locally, they want 210 bucks for 5 yards of mulch delivered from the local landscape company. I moved all 105 bags in a car over a course of multiple trips. I bought roughly 7.5 yards of mulch for the same price of buying 5 yards from a non box store. There is an aroma for the first day or so, but it quickly dissipates. This is a great product especially when you need yards of it at a reasonable cost. My house was a foreclosure, so it hadn't been mulched in over 5 years. I am very pleased with this product and will likely buy it again next year when it is on sale 5 for 10.",
