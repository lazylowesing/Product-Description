            "text": "I ordered this drill press from Lowes on a Saturday and received it the following Wednesday. This is without doubt the best new drill press available in this price range on the market today! Delta has built the beefiest machine of it's kind around. You can tilt the 14x20 table 90 deg. left or right and up to 48 deg. forward, nobody else's press does that. Speed changes are the easiest of the big three companies not using a Reeves drive mechanism. Assembly was a breeze and can be done by one man,I am 65 years old and I did it easily. You simply can't go wrong with this machine! Get one now.",

            "text": "The fit and finish of this machine is second to none. The 6\" spindle travel is a nice improvement. Most comparable presses do not move 6 inches. Right out of the box, setup is simple, although you will definitely need two people as most of the weight in a drill press is in the head, and lifting that heavy head onto the column requires 2 people. The laser is easy to align and the light is nice. The tension release lever makes changing speeds a snap. The table is large and designed for woodworkers - it is accommodating to clamps and jigs. The motor is quiet and runs well. I have ZERO complaints about this machine and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high quality drill press for home use.",

Delta definitely saught the needs snd wants of and from the user when designing this unit! Everything is where is should be. Right out of the box its not even .1° off bit to table, its belt change system is simple and brilliant in design. I highly recommend this drill press. I wish Lowes stocked Biesemyer 18-901 fence for it because they are designed work well together.",

            "text": "Glad to see this particular brand readily available through Lowes. I purchased my first Delta over 20-yrs ago and still have it in operation today. I wanted something larger and looked at the Craftsman & some other brands but nothing comes close to the quality you'll find in this brand or model for the money. Everything from the fit & finish to the large base & multi position tilting table, lazer & LED lamp with aluminum base & lamp housing gives this drill an authoritative look. Runs very quiet and with the finned aluminum heat sink on motor housing lets you know it can handle the big jobs. Also nice is the ease of changing the drill speeds. Set up is easy and base with pole can be placed in drill head body while still laying on its side (on the floor inside box) and then stood up as an assembly. Please keep in mind before buying, these particular types of machinery outlast refrigerators and most peoples lives so make sure you buy one that's layed out as well as this one or you'll regret it!",
