I have purchased only Mapei thin set & grout since then. This particular purchase was for my 5th tiling project. If a 60+ yr old woman, who had never laid a tile in her life before the first project, can use it with ease anyone should be able to get the results they want. I am including a picture of each of my projects. The first was a small entry floor, second was my kitchen and dining room floor, third was a fireplace hearth, fourth was the main bath tub surround and last was my bathroom floor.",

            "text": "We purchased this grout first in Timberwolf.  Once installed it was so light it looked white.  So, we removed it and bought the Pearl Gray because it showed to be darker on the bag.  After it was installed, it appeared to be the same light color as the Timberwolf.  Rather than spend any more time and money (it cost us an additional $100 and several days of labor to scrape out the first color) we decided to get some Valspar Solid Stain in their gray color.  It took us about 5-6 hours to apply it in a 130 sq ft room but the color is much better.  The tile in these pictures is actually a light gray wood-look but they show the before and after and the difference in the grout. From now on we will buy our grout from a tile or brick store.",

            "text": "MAPEI is supposed to be great grout,and why we purchased it.  But like I wish I saw before using this color it is not even close to the sample color.  We laid our wood plank tile as tight as allowed for a minimal grout line, and purchased Sahara Beige which the sample showed it blended perfectly so my floor would look like wood vs tile.  It came out light gray and now I have noticeable grout lines.  I was so happy about the look of the floors until the grout was dried.  Not sure how to fix it now.  We mixed in a sealer, so I'm not sure if applying a color on top will work.  MAPEI colorant has bad ratings, so I don't want to make it worse.",

I love my home and i love shopping at lowes for what i need to make my home beautiful. i was the one who installed my tile and grout so im very familiar with the product. just like any grout, clean up is a slight pain. Haze, haze, and more haze. But once its finally all off the floor it is stunning. Make sure to seal it and it will stay beautiful for a very long time. Do not be intimidated to have white grout in your home with pets or children, again as long as you seal it!!!",

Dried into inconsistent colorations. whiter here, darker there. good thing that the tile has shades of cream and beige, else the grout would be really noticeable. Plus it's in our mudroom so if anyone privately wonders, they may think it's from  wetness from the outside. Used another bag of Mapei warm grey to go with grey marble-like porcelain tiles in our laundry room. that one dried into inconsistent coloration as well but good thing the tiles went under our washer/dryer. I'd avoid this brand and hope that their uncoupling mortar works out for the porcelain tiles we spent two days laying down.",

I added a photo of some of the extra grout that was left over, clearly showing the color fail was not efflorescence, and it goes clear through. I took a photo of their color card against the backsplash to make a comparison. I realize that it is written that the color is not exact but this is MAJORLY off! When I purchased black grout, I did not expect to get slate gray. I am beyond myself with grief over this! About the only thing to correct this is a grout stain or paint. I surely did not anticipate this added expense of both money and time. I hope that anyone that is looking for a black grout will look elsewhere.",

Mixing and applying five pound batches, I never had a problem with the grout setting or hardening before I was done grouting. Now that the grout has cured, it looks great, and it's holding the tiles firmly in place. If you're applying this to marble tile, seal the tile before you grout. Also, ensure you wipe the haze off the tiles two hours after you've cleaned it with the sponge. I waited a day, and the haze was very difficult to remove.",

Grout looked great night one immediately after install but by days 2-3 once dry the color was very inconsistent and the darker gray color as advertised is now light gray in most areas.  From online research, common offenders are too much water in the mix or too much water at clean up, I am certain that neither was the case.  Mixed per exact instructions, consistency was spot on and clean up was done the right way, lightly damp sponge with no excess water and slow, just enough to make final clean up easier.  Very disappointing to be in this situation, solutions that I have seen are to \"refresh\" grout with another product but the thought of spending more money and laboring for hours on this after doing it the right way \"according to manufacturer instruction\" is far from ideal.",

Despite these two tips, it still dried lighter. As for the grout itself, it is easy to work with, but finding the right color has been trial and error. I will likely be switching to another brand.

I wanted a darker color that is closer to dirt colored, and this is not it. It is a nice light color, but I know it is going to be difficult to keep looking clean.

We used almost the whole 25 pounds for our 44 square foot bathroom floor of 2x2 octagonal marble tile. The directions are clear and easy to follow. Mixing and applying five pound batches, I never had a problem with the grout setting or hardening before I was done grouting. Now that the grout has cured, it looks great, and it's holding the tiles firmly in place. If you're applying this to marble tile, seal the tile before you grout. Also, ensure you wipe the haze off the tiles two hours after you've cleaned it with the sponge. I waited a day, and the haze was very difficult to remove.",

Grout looked great night one immediately after install but by days 2-3 once dry the color was very inconsistent and the darker gray color as advertised is now light gray in most areas.  From online research, common offenders are too much water in the mix or too much water at clean up, I am certain that neither was the case.  Mixed per exact instructions, consistency was spot on and clean up was done the right way, lightly damp sponge with no excess water and slow, just enough to make final clean up easier.  Very disappointing to be in this situation, solutions that I have seen are to \"refresh\" grout with another product but the thought of spending more money and laboring for hours on this after doing it the right way \"according to manufacturer instruction\" is far from ideal.",

Despite these two tips, it still dried lighter. As for the grout itself, it is easy to work with, but finding the right color has been trial and error. I will likely be switching to another brand. If you choose this brand, I recommend testing out the color and allowing to dry completely on some extra tiles to prevent unsatisfactory results.",

However, as soon as it dries, it is a medium charcoal color and NOT black. I came here hoping that my grout-reviewing community would be able to come to my rescue and recommend some sort of acid, refresh, sealer, etc. to fix this. I really want black grout. Anyone have a tried and true method? Did we get a bum bag? Very frustrating.",

If a person was doing a large job they would buy a large container of grout. If u have a small job typically you would buy a small bag of grout. The average person doesn't have a scale that can measure out a couple pounds of product. But even if we do we still have to guess at the amount of water to add to it.

They do not stand behind their product, even when they mislabel the bags and or have an issue with the mix. This is the opinion of a tile setter with 32 years of experience.

After \"installing\" the grout in the bathroom project I was working on I read other reviews to see the same result as mine.Let's begin from the top. The instructions on the package could have been better. The instructions are drawings and at times I was not EXACTLY sure what they were saying. I had my Dad's experience and help so he knew what to do. I LOVED the color as I was spreading the grout across the 1/8\" seam. It was a nice contrast against the light brown (tan) tile I was using. The next day I was excited to see how it dried and it was not the dark brown I saw the day before, nor was it matching the color on the package. It was basically the same color as the tile and I was not impressed. At this point I wanted to get the bathroom back together and I was not about to tear all the grout up to change the color. In addition to drying a much lighter color I see some color variations throughout. I mixed the grout according to the instructions (mix, rest, mix) and I mixed more than enough to cover the entire floor the first time.So, now I have to love the grout the way it is and chalk it up to charm. After reading other reviews it seems the best way to mix the grout would be to use distilled water. As to the lonjevity and the quality of the product, I know not, but I am sure it will be great.",

It dries to a color that looks like it's been out in the sun for several years. I had to dig out all the dried grout, and I then used spectralock epoxy grout with much better results, although it is much harder to install due to fast drying times.Fast forward 3 years, and my husband is now tiling the bathroom floors. We decided to try a darker grout (charcoal) and went with Mapei Keracolor as Lowes no longer sells Spectralock. I was naive to think maybe it was just my inexperience with the first attempt grouting. Unfortunately, once again the tile dried to a terrible, sunfaded color. It's actually worse this time as some portions of the grout are dark (the color they should be) and other portions are almost white. The attached picture should help show the inconsistency of color. This faded color cannot be blamed on improper mixing with water as this grout was mixed at the same time, and it still has this color inconsistency, even within one 12\" grout line.I wish Lowes would reconsider selling such an inferior product, or at least provide more options in their stock. I would really recommend for customers to purchase a different product than Mapei grout.",

I started with Mocha, but it turned grey. Yes. It turned grey. This is because hard water can effect the grout (calcium etc in water). If you have hard water, use gallon jug bottled water. If you did used hard water, spray CLR with a hard nylon brush on the grout. Preferably before sealing it. This should solve the problem. If not, use sealer remover, wash floor, then CLR, and you can always use the stain that acts as a sealer. I just used CLR with a nylon brush, and the color came out great!

            "text": "I purchased Mapei Keracolor grout in Mocha several years ago when tiling my kitchen floor. After installation on half of the floor, I realized the grout was not the right color. It dries to a color that looks like it's been out in the sun for several years. I had to dig out all the dried grout, and I then used spectralock epoxy grout with much better results, although it is much harder to install due to fast drying times.Fast forward 3 years, and my husband is now tiling the bathroom floors. We decided to try a darker grout (charcoal) and went with Mapei Keracolor as Lowes no longer sells Spectralock. I was naive to think maybe it was just my inexperience with the first attempt grouting. Unfortunately, once again the tile dried to a terrible, sunfaded color. It's actually worse this time as some portions of the grout are dark (the color they should be) and other portions are almost white. The attached picture should help show the inconsistency of color. This faded color cannot be blamed on improper mixing with water as this grout was mixed at the same time, and it still has this color inconsistency, even within one 12\" grout line.I wish Lowes would reconsider selling such an inferior product, or at least provide more options in their stock. I would really recommend for customers to purchase a different product than Mapei grout.",

Mixing all needed at one time will give consistant color across the floor. The manufacturer recommend that you wait seven days before you seal it because different areas, water amounts, and other things can effect it. It must be totaly dry all the way through. I started with Mocha, but it turned grey. Yes. It turned grey. This is because hard water can effect the grout (calcium etc in water). If you have hard water, use gallon jug bottled water. If you did used hard water, spray CLR with a hard nylon brush on the grout. Preferably before sealing it. This should solve the problem. If not, use sealer remover, wash floor, then CLR, and you can always use the stain that acts as a sealer. I just used CLR with a nylon brush, and the color came out great! If you realy want a beautiful floor, a little hard work and love is all it takes!",

It may be a bit lighter, but not by much. It is most certainly not white or even off white. I used this with the Caribbean Slate and La Balantina brown tile and it looks fantastic. Note that Caribbean Slate is a bit of an off-white, almost beige tile and the grout is darker than the tile, offering a nice contrast. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it may actually be slightly lighter than advertised (though it's pretty tough to tell unless you have grout lines an inch wide to do a proper side by side comparison) and because I have no idea how durable it is at this point. I'm including a picture of the grout with Caribbean Slate tile and my white fridge in the background so all 3 colors can be compared to each other.",

It may be a bit lighter, but not by much. It is most certainly not white or even off white. I used this with the Caribbean Slate and La Balantina brown tile and it looks fantastic. Note that Caribbean Slate is a bit of an off-white, almost beige tile and the grout is darker than the tile, offering a nice contrast. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it may actually be slightly lighter than advertised (though it's pretty tough to tell unless you have grout lines an inch wide to do a proper side by side comparison) and because I have no idea how durable it is at this point. I'm including a picture of the grout with Caribbean Slate tile and my white fridge in the background so all 3 colors can be compared to each other.",

I will deal with it, as it is on my countertop....but will someone please tell me what brand to get that is true to color, as I will be very, very upset if the floor isn't the dark brown that I want. I've even bought the Grout Boost ($50 for 2 liters!!)...which I haven't used yet, but I don't want to mix it with Mapei grout, assuming it will fix this problem!! It has even changed the color of my tumbled marble on the countertop, with a haze that just won't go away. I'm told you can't put the haze remover on tumbled marble. So....all in all....I believe this grout should cost no more than sandbox sand, and should have no other color claim than white!!",

We've done tile before, so we have a good idea of what we're doing.Followed the instructions exactly (amount of grout, amount of water#, and the product was basically unusable -- way too dry to be able to apply properly. It was like crumbly sand on a beach. There was no way to adequately work it in to our grout lines, or to use the float to properly wipe it away. It just made a big mess. I ended up having to add more water to make it into a workable consistency.But, once done, this grout exhibited really horrible efflorescence #the white powdery look in the grout). We've tried lots of solutions, but so far are still struggling with fixing the problem. If you look on the mfr's website, it'll say something to the effect of \"you got the grout too wet, and that's drawing the salts out of the cement.\" In other words, it's not their fault, if you used too much water.Of course, as I noted above, the product was unusable when following their recommended amounts of water -- so there appears to be no way to have a successful outcome.We've never had such issues with other brands of grout, on multiple projects. I would definitely recommend against using this product.",

Similar to paint if you pick a color you expect to get that color but that was not the case.\n\nAfter I grouted it looked great and was the color I had expected but after several hours of drying it turned into a grayish color totally changing the look of the floor and leaving me with a much different color then I had planned.

I mixed this stuff according to the directions and noticed it seemed to be slightly foamy as if I mixed it too much but I did exactly what the instructions said.     Then I waited a couple minutes per instructions and mixed again.     I then started using it and noticed air bubbles in several places that I had to go back over.    Because of the air bubbles this project took much longer than I anticipated.     Also, the color of the grout dried much lighter than what was indicated on the bag.    About a week after I tiled Moms backsplash my Mom called and said the grout sunk in several areas.     I wonder if this is because of the air bubbles.     Should have just used the same grout I had used before.",

I figured I didn't need to read the reviews because I knew it was a good brand and figured if they are going to show what the color is on the bag it has to be that color once it dries. Similar to paint if you pick a color you expect to get that color but that was not the case.\n\nAfter I grouted it looked great and was the color I had expected but after several hours of drying it turned into a grayish color totally changing the look of the floor and leaving me with a much different color then I had planned. In order to truly test this product before grouting you would need to mix a batch and set it thin so it dries as it would in-between the tiles to find out its true color.",

I worked in small batches and did not add any additional water to the mix. I let it dry to the point of firmness and then wiped it down once with a very lightly/barely damp sponge to smooth the grout line and then immediately dried the grout lines with a cloth so there was NO water on the grout.

After mixing and applying the grout, letting it set and cure, I was a little dissappointed at the outcome of the color. The color key on the card was spot on with my pre-existing grout and when it was said and done, the grout color came out two shades lighter. I am now having to purchase a grout pen with a darker color in order to match the previous grout color. If I cannot find a color that will work, I am going to have to purchase another bag of a color that is darker then what matches on the card. My recommendation is to either regrout the whole area with the same colr new grout or purchase a shade or two daker than what you want. Other than the color issue, this product was easy to use and is great for first time grouters like myself. I am sure that professionals are more skilled at matching the colors then I am, but purchasing a product for DiY, they need to make the colors on the packages match the outcome colors.",

As most others here have said, the final color of this grout when dried isn't even close to what the sample on the bag shows and it doesn't come out a uniform color, it's darker in some areas and lighter in others. I followed the instructions to the letter, I used distilled water and I made sure not to get it overly wet when sponging it off. It still came out considerably lighter than the sample color.When I did the backsplash (the unsanded grout) I did each side separately. I mixed the first side using the maximum water, which turned out a little thin so I mixed the other side using the minimum amount, even that made no difference. To make sure I didn't over wet the grout I wrung out the sponge as much as I possibly could and only worked the grout enough to remove the excess and give it a slightly concave surface. (This left a lot of grout residue on the tile which took considerable effort to get off after drying.) The next day it was the same as the floor, no difference at all.The final insult came when I used the so called matching caulk. At first the color was quite a bit lighter than the sample on the tube, not as light as the grout but the contrast wasn't so bad and I figured I could live with it. However unlike the grout, it dried considerably darker, darker than the sample picture even. The contrast between it and the grout is way to much. There was also a lot of shinkage, when I applied the caulk I worked it until the couture was even with the grout, but when it dried it sucked back into the gap so much it will need a second coat. This actually worked to my advantage because at least I don't need to remove it to apply a color that matches.",

I thought it was a little stiff as I was mixing it, but I had put in the 2 qts. of water as directed. When I had finished mixing and re-mixing, again per directions, the grout was so stiff I could hardly spread it. I checked and found that it was not recommended to add more water. Before I could finish the floor (about 1 1/2 hour) the grout was so hard that I couldn't scrape it out of the bucket. When I went back to Lowe's and asked the flooring guy, he said that it shouldn't have set up that fast, 3-4 hours working time, He did cut me some slack and give me another #25 bag at the #10 bag price (they don't stock #10 bags in black), but since I only needed about #10 to finish....To finish a long story, if you are using this and it looks too stiff add more water. I only mixed a partial bag the second time and didn't try to calculate the water needed, I just added water until it looked right, about milkshake thick. The second attempt went well and looks great. This was the only problem that I had.",

Then you get a shock when it dries quite a bit lighter.  Very disappointing to put so much time into a job and have it ruined like this.  I've used the Permacolor grout and caulk from Home Depot and they match exactly.  I expected the same from this.",

Also - there are a lot of five star reviews for this product with no comment -highly suspicious. Mixed the exact amount of filtered water - ended up using a little more because it just fell out of the grout lines. After hours of hard work we noticed that the grout was drying almost white in places. You need perfect conditions that are not listed on the label to get the best results - the perfect amount of the right filtered water and the perfect application time and possibly a bag of grout that is not defective. If your grout color is important to you do NOT use this grout unless you like to gamble. Attempting now to darken lighter areas by rewetting and slowing drying time as stated in another review. I also noticed that 411 sealer slightly darkened the grout on a sample I made so I will use it after I've attempted to darken the light areas. We have two bathrooms to renovate and I will not be using Mapei. If I could go back in time, I would not do it differently - I would have bought a different grout.",

This happens when you have minerals in your water that react with the grout pigments or if you are using too much water when wiping the tiles clean. This makes the grout milky or white. There's nothing you can really do now that you've installed the grout, other than let it fade over the years, but it will never be really dark. My suggestion would be for grout that is already installed, use the pigmented sealer by Mapei called grout refresh in the Chamois coloway. This will seal the grout and make it a uniform color. In the future, use as little water as you can when installing, and use distilled water to mix the grout.",
