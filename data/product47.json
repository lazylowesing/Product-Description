            "text": "I bought this grill in 2011-2012, It rusted out once when a hail storm detroyed my cover.  I've since rebuilt it and removed most all of the rust and repainted.  Replaced any defective parts.  Still works fine.  I do reccomend lining the interior with heavy duty aluminum foil to protect. I replaced the cover and also use a tarp over that for double layer protection.  Nothing messing with it now.  I would say that when I bought this grill it was on sale for $199 and has since gone up to $299 and now $329.  I've seen it go on sale for $269 and for $249 but never has it gone back down to $199.  FYI Home Depot has the newer model of this unit from Char Griller in the low $200's.  I'm not sure why Lowes continues to raise the price on this unit which came out in 2011.  Their cost has not gone up, but the margin they are making on the item has.",

The Wheels and the Lower frame are \"Poor\" quality... and no matter how you assemble it.. at best it is shaky... I have the side fire box attached.. the spacers that come with that... are a little to long.. so the fire box sits at an awkward upward angle.. and since you have to move it from that side .. it makes moving it a pain in the ...... always feels like the Box will rip off... and the screws stripped out the same day I built it.. I will have to redesign the mounting add a support bar and use full length screws... all of which could of of been avoided... if it was built the right way from the factory... I like the way it smokes and cooks... a little tricky regulating the temps.. but with some further Mods..(Charcoal side) all will be OK... Still BIG BANG for the BUCK... and the factory cover works just fine with the Side fire box...It was a House Warming - Christmas Present from my Mom.... Thanks again Mom......:)",

            "text": "Ok to start with, I have read almost every review of this product from every source possible and there are some great points made and some that are just silly. Step by step and how I overcame some of the issue that seem to be real and the silly things as well.Packaging – This is a very heavy grill in a single box. It weighs in at approximately 168lbs. The first unit I got from Lowes had damage on the edge. Damage was not noticed until I got home and started taking it apart. The damage was were the top and bottom shell set and had crushed the edges of both parts. Lowes replaced it without issue. Fit and Form – This unit is made with some fairly heavy steel but they will still flex and bend until completely mounted and secured. I would suggest a Dead Blow hammer to help correct this fitment issues. Smoke leakage –When installing the fire box I found that the 2 standoffs were too long, causing a major gap between the box and the body. I cut a 1/4” off them leveling the fire box and closing the gap. I also used 2000 deg. RTV gasket seal between the box and body.  Leakage around the door and cover was also a big issue. I fixed this by adding self-stick gasket used in the EGG smokers and Fireplaces. Rust – This is one of the more silly things. I live in the desert so rain isn't a big deal, common since says metal rust. Take precautions, cure the unit, sand off small rust spots before they become an issue, paint the outside with High Temp Engine Paint or Stove Paint, cover it up with a good grill cover, don't store it out in the rain and take care of it like for it. Overall- This is a nice grill setup, it's a great price compared to some of the professional grills costing in the Thousands, it pretty well made and most importantly it works. My total cost for the extras I used was less than $20.00 bucks and I feel they were well worth it and with proper care and cleaning think this grill will last many years.",

The company said the metal was heated to a temperature that exceeded the manufacturers warranty causing the metal to weaken and rust. I only used the original burners included, so I guess I should have only cooked on the low or medium setting. The manual never said anything about that. I think they used cheap, inexpensive metal to make this unit. Also, one of the \"cast iron\" grates came snapped in two. I guess that was made cheaply as well. BUYER BEWARE !!",

I had one of these a few years ago before moving states. Previous one was definitely a 4.5/5, maybe a 5/5. It was an amazing grill for what it was made of and the effort it took to assemble it. This one, the directions were pretty straight forward and updated, but could be simplified or clarified in many parts still. Just pay attention to the pictures and my advice, take it easy and slow. From a fabrication stand point, the actual hardware is cheap, but what do you expect. The material is a little thin, but the whole unit probably weighs in at around 160 lbs without packaging... so what do you expect. My main concern was with how everything came out of the box. Don't get me wrong, assembled and currently sitting I like this grill a lot, however, I deal a lot with Lowe's and the parts were definitely mishandled somewhere. Some of the items were hard to line up and still have major gaps for the cooking area. I'll have to bend it back and fix those areas before use. Lots of scuff marks, almost like it fell off the truck or something. But I did ask for an unassembled unit so I could fit it in my vehicle to take home, so what do I really expect.... Anyways... here's some pictures of it fully assembled. Probably took me roughly 3 hours watching TV, drinking some brewskis, and taking my time to follow the directions to make sure I didn't miss directives. Would recommend this grill and would buy again.",

Not flimsy heavy and when tight handle moves this in and out of garage sturdy! I am a Charcoal grilling smoker. It is nice and big example to full racks of spare ribs with plenty of room left over. I inderect smoke at least weekly. So great. Use side burner to light the charcoal starter. So perfect for that. Use gas very little for a quick burger at lunch or hot dogs. One Note char griller sent me a new grilling grate no issue due to it cracked when opened. Great Experience. Love it! Added a foil layer around lid opening to seal smoke in. Cheap mod there! Take care of it! Will treat you perfectly!",

            "text": "I've had this duo grill with the smoke box for approx 2 months. Have smoked ribs and a pork butt. All have come out excellent. There are hot spots when smoking on the charcoal side. Food needs to be on the far left side of the grill as the heat from the smoke box is too intense for the food thats close to it. Makes it hard to fill the grill up because you need to rotate away from the smoke box side. Opening up and switching food around loses heat. The thermostat isn't worth a hill of beans, but none of the dial types are. You must use a good probe thermometer when smoking anyway. The gas side works GREAT. Very happy. 3 burners are plenty for my husband and myself. The side burner is excellent for starting charcoal in a chimney starter. Great job designing that! I had Lowes assemble and deliver. IT WAS FREE Whoop Whoop. That's the only way to go. I too have had grease drip off the hood down the back when the hood is opened. Should fix that design flaw. I also ordered a very long Arkansas Razorbacks BBQ mat from Lowes online to help save my concrete patio. Make sure you get a cover and use it. I fear rust will be the biggest con I will have. So far,so good...",

Make a full ring with your coal, if smoking wet your chips and spread on top. Light one side and your off. Temperature control was a breeze for the coal, the gas sometimes is finicky. \nTip make sure you shim the barrels to drain to the centre. Grease tray works best if gravity is in its favour.\nAdding a wood stove rope seal is beneficial around the lower barrel, top lid sits over the edge of the lower and when smoking/slow cooking you will have condensing grease from the lid drip down. BBQ mat or a drip sheet of plywood a good add on for underneath BBQ \n\nDownfall is Lowes does not carry the char grill portable charcoal/side smoker",

Other than learning how much Mesquite wood to put in the smoke box to keep that 225 degree sweet spot after a couple of hours I had the hang of it and we were off and running!The whole point of buying this unit is getting the versatility of having a gas grill, charcoal grill & an offset smoker in one affordable unit.So far I'm very pleased and would definitely recommend.",

First thing I did was to replace the plastic wheels with 10\" rubber pneumatic ones from HFT-$4ea and a new thicker and longer axle; next, I converted it to natural gas. Had to disassemble the inlet manifold and drill out the jets to 1/16\". It works terrific! Have only used the charcoal side perhaps 3x, tho I thought we would use that side far more. Hard to argue with the 'right now' aspect of the gas side. Its a very heavy unit, and seems quite sturdy. At $250, it seems a very good value/ I would buy it again.I need to investigate to see if it will accommodate a rotisserie get up.",

Since the then, we've used our grill at least once, if not twice, a week. The gas is great when we are in a hurry, but the charcoal side gives us the option to do slower and smokier flavors. The side burner is an incredible addition. One night, we cooked our entire meal with the grill! Meat, vegetables and rice cooking all at the same time can't get any easier.",

Like any metal, clean it and protect it and it will last a very long time. I will say in any charcoal grill, never use lighter fluid or self lighting charcoal, they contain petroleum products that will stick to the metal and cause rust. The cover they have for the grill doesnt fit with the side box. I bought an extra large good quailty motorcycle cover ( one that is water proof not water resistant) that fits the grill and side box perfect. A very happy BBQer.",

A gas side that is completely separate from the charcoal side, as well as an add-on firebox that can be used for smoking, which I added. For the price it is and for home use it is an excellent choice. I would not recommended it for any commercial applications as it is not meant for that. The design also allows for repairs to be done fairly easily in the future that make this a lasting product as well. I had no troubles putting it together, however it takes longer than the 45 minutes that they say, which is fine, because I had fun doing it. It is a very heavy grill, with the firebox attached, so I'm not too worried about anyone making off with it. If they did, they would have some trouble. For the do-it-yourself-er, it can be modified to suit any need as the construction is almost all heavy gauge rolled sheet steel with heavy tack and seam welding. All in all, I am extremely happy with the grill. And for those that care, I am a native Texan who's dad taught him well. Note: bullhorns are an option I added.",

It warped so badly that the grates would not stay in place.   I filed a warranty claim but it was denied.  The stated reason for the denial was the fire I built must have been too hot.  The fire I built was with standard charcoal briquettes.    I had to take a hammer and beat the grill back into shape .The grill is also very prone to rust.  I have had to spray paint the grill to cover the rust.  I have kept the grill covered with the grill cover that is an accessory for this product.  The grill cover has faded from black to light gray.I do like the this grill is both gas and charcoal.  I have the side-fire box accessory that allows for smoking items with indirect heat.  I have enjoyed this accessory.    In summary I feel there are better made products on the market.  If you do purchase this product, I recommend that you have two accessories  (1) a hammer to beat it back into shape and (2) a can of black spray paint to cover the rust.",

My neighbors were jealous and my the end of 2012 summer the whole block had one. This grill was my baby and I maintained it like it was my religion. Within a year the thermometer broke and I noticed rust, wire brushed it off and coated with heat resistant paint then oiled it up. Year and half, burner covers started to look frail and rust was back. Year 2, legs are completely rusted out, burner covers crumbled from rust and I'm left with a hunk of junk that is literally on its last leg. Both neighbors who still live on my block experienced the same issues.Contacted Char Griller - they only honor 1 year warranty and rust is not included. Only manufactures defects. I consider selling low quality parts at high quality pricing a manufactures defect. Parts I need cost $55-$75 and they have the nerve to charge $25 for shipping. At least make the parts affordable to those who trusted your company. $400 for 2.5 years, plus the time I spent Experience it, is not my idea of money well spent.You've been warned.",

That was dissappointing. What was more disappointing was that even with the cover on, my grill had already lost it's color and was starting to rust. That was by summer of 2010. The rust has gotten so bad, I'm thinking about buying a new grill, but one that's more durable and weather proof. Grills are supposed to be outside and you want them to continue to look and function like when you first bought it for more than 1.5 years. If I wanted an indoor grill, I would buy another George Forman (and that aint grilling!).",

I was afraid the fixed draft stacks on top of the gas grill would result in flare ups but so far that hasn't been a problem. The charcoal grill is easy to adjust and regulate both height of coals and burn rate. It has plenty of room for indirect grilling. The thermometers do need calibrating. One reads about 30° high, the other is nearly 100° high compared to an instant read digital infrared thermometer aimed under the lid at the grill thermometer elements.Unfortunately the quality construction and double grill make the Duo heavy and hard to move so I rated it good instead of excellent on features and design. Due to the weight, it really needs four wheels; probably pneumatic. Also, the open shelf on the bottom is pretty much useless. An enclosed cabinet for storage of cleaning tools, etc. would be more practical. The gas lines are too short for easy connection. There are no pictures showing the recommended orientation of the tank and the lines come pre-attached from the regulator to the grill and single burner. The regulator won't fit under the leg cross brace so the only way to connect the tank without a severe bend in the line is to remove the hose from the burner control and route it around the leg. Still, once assembled it seems like a solid grill and compared to others in the same price range, a good value. I would definitely recommend it.",

            "text": "ok our last grill was a cheep little wal mart gas grill we got  for under $80, it lasted around 4 years give or take and even though we kept it covered after a few years it rusted out.  My wife insisted on a gas grill, me, i prefer charcoal, and wanted a smoker type grill. so i figured this would be a good compromise, got the add on smoker box also. assembly was around 3 hours which is roughly normal from what i have read,  good solid unit when all nuts and bolts are tightened up.  controlling the heat is easy once you get used to it. does leak smoke but that can be fixed with heat sealant and fire tape. I've used it to smoke several meals now and my wife loved it all. easy to clean up, as far as all the complaints about rusting and such,  yes, its cast iron so if it isnt properly cleaned up  and wiped down with oil after each use it will rust. I let it cool to the touch, use dawn dish soap and a scrub pad to clean it, then allow it to dry, then i spray it with veggie oil and wipe down every inch of it, i dont bother covering it do to keeping it in the garge, ( garage never smelled better. lol). the guys at the Elizabethtown ky store were awsome as usual with tips from assembly to cleaning.  got it on sale for memorial day and it was the best money i spent in a long time. love this grill. !!!!!!!!! would of given 5 stars except for the loss of smoke and heat wich is a simple fix.",

Given the rust situation, you may wonder why we bought another one. We like the set-up with charcoal and gas. The lids are heavy and the grill part held up well. We're going to try to make the support structure last longer by putting the legs on wood supports that drain well and regularly treating the legs and undercarriage with material to stop rust. We really wish the support structure was as well made as the grill, but we still love the grill.",

I do most of my cooking with charcoal (use natural lump wood) but it is nice to have a full size gas grill on the other side for big meals. The side fire box and a chimney starter for the charcoal are a must buy. I had never smoked meat before buying this grill but getting started was easy. The results were delicious. There are many different books and websites to help with smoking. Construction is better than the average grill and is sturdy with lots of storage. Assembly time, including side fire box, was 1-1/2 hours. I highly recommend getting the custom cover and properly \"seasoning\" the grill as directed. Buy this grill!!",

Steel will rust! Buy a new Caddilac, look under it in a few months, guess what you'll find, RUST! Best advice I can give is keep your grill greased and expect to paint the outside every season with a $7.00 can of high heat paint. Would you think it's cheaper to buy a new grill? It's all about maintainance. I bought this grill 2 yrs. ago and I love it! For my excellent ribeyes I fire up the gas side to sear them on both sides and then I offset cook them over KINGSFORD charcoal to perfection. I'm not picking on anybody but nothing lasts forever. With care and proper maintainance this grill will make you a backyard grilling guru. Just LOVE it! PEACE & BBQ",

I can hold a 225F temp for 3 to 4 hours with one load of charcoal and some wood. I saw this is now a black Friday special for $199.00 That is an incredible deal! I paid $300 including the firebox.1 tip. if you are using the firebox for smoking. Turn the coal pan in the charcoal frill side of the unit upside down.

            "text": "I bought this unit a year ago because it was cheap and had the features that I wanted. I live in Florida where summer rains and high humidity can make short work of anything made of steel. It is imperitive that you coat the grill inside and out with a heavy cooking oil and fire it up for a few hours before you use it. This is a fairly high maintenance grill, but it will last for several years if you keep it clean, oiled, and covered. I added a firebox, but, as is, the heat distrubution in the grill is terrible. I made a baffle of 1/4\" steel that makes this grill distribute heat and smoke perfectly. I added wheels to the other legs and braced the firebox and put an X brace between the legs in the back to prevent it from racking. With these modifications I can do virtually anything that any grill can do, regardless of the price. I do almost all my cooking with charcoal but it's nice to have the gas grill for those times when it is convenient. The ability to adjust the height of the charcoal is an imperitive feature, in my opinion. I would like the charcoal grill lid to have a tighter fit but I stuff strips of old towels under the outer edges when I smoke. I would also like the steel used in the charcoal grill to be a heavier gauge to help retaing heat.I am more than pleased with this unit, because it can do everything that I need, but it is not for everyone. If you're not willing to season it with oil, keep it clean, keep it out of the rain, then don't buy it because it will not last.I have very little rust, even after a year of it sitting in the weather all the time. I use the cover made for it. The cover is faded from the intense Florida sun, but no holes or tears yet. I have not had any problems with any part of the grill even after a year of extensive use.",

The charcoal side is great for steaks or for slow cooking/smoking a pork roast. The grill is fairly easy to clean and the grates easy to keep clean. I've read a lot of reviews complaining of rust, and so far I haven't seen any, but you have to season the grill as directed in the manual. I'm sure as time goes on, it will start to rust somewhere. I've owned expensive stainless steel grills costing a lot more than this one, and they have all rusted. If this one does rust out in 5 years, I'll just buy another one. I like it that much.

I have only cooked on the gas side twice and the charcoal side once but here are my first impressions.Pro'sSpace saverSeems to be decent constructionLove the removable charcoal grate. Just remove and dump ashesLove that you can adjust the charcoal to cooking grate space. You can adjust the charcoal to very close to sear your meat and then move it back down.Very roomy racks on both sides.Temp gauge on both sides.The high of the side burner is very hot and brings water to a boil in a flash.ConsTerrible design where propane tank sits. The hole the tank sits in is too small. I put my tank in it and it takes two of us to snatch it out because it gets stuck. Also, the crossbar between the two legs is at the same height as the regulator so I can't screw it into the tank. I had to set the tank on the outside of the frame.Can't keep the the gas side down below 400 degrees unless you use only one burner.The low on the side burner too hot. Can't simmer something but this has been my experience on the last couple of grills I have owned.Overall I like the grill but only time will tell. I cook on it at least 4 times a week and really wanted a Weber but at this point that was too much money.",

On the gas side I have found that it burns very hot and the burners don't have any real ability to regulate the temperature. Low burns at about 425-450 degrees and high is around 600 plus degrees. If you want to grill those ribs slow and low you may need to get creative or look elsewhere. I'm interested in adding the smoker box attachment to the charcoal side for this very reason.

The first year was fine, and kept all clean at all times, and did follow manufacturer instructions. By the second year, I had to dismantle it completly, sand off the rust and repaint a lot.. Was just a waste of time.After a couple uses, the grease will stick to it, and as you try to remove, so will the paint or caoting that might have.Great concept, but it fails.

One thing, had one screw to strip out, but I had an extra nut and bolt at home. The second thing, the propane holder was a little small or I have the wrong propane tank, again no problem, I filed the hole and now the tank does not get stuck.Now for the negative reviews I read about the temperature, I have no problem achieving the 300-400 degrees using both the propane and charcoal sides. To give you a heads up, our first steaks off the propane side were blackened and well done, this being the grill cooking on low. Needless to say we like our steaks medium rare.I would highly recommend this grill for cooking on both sides.",

This is a great grill for the money.I used the gas side several times and I read some of the other reviews about the heat going up past 400. But gas is like charcoal you have to control it by turning off burners. I only used 1 burner and did indirect heat and maintained the heat right where I wanted it 300 degrees. I did assemble this myself and it was really easy. It took me about 1 hr and 45 min to complete. I would recommend this to anyone. I'm planning to fire up the charcoal side this weekend and cook some chicken halves or Boston butt. I love the convenience of have the gas to throw some hamburgers & hotdogs on.A must buy if you love to grill!!",

The drip shields over each burner have rusted completely through. They burners have in turn rusted. I was so disappointed at the fact it has been susceptible to rusting in a short time. And, I have purchased two grill covers that are about $50 each. While it is outside and sits on the deck, it has constantly been covered whenever not in use. Still, it has rusted and that means it will need to be replaced. I have looked into purchasing parts from the maker, but if I have to replace all the burners, shields and other rusted parts I may as well buy a new grill.",

Bad rains and winds here and it is holding steady! I love the storage compartment under the grill, the instance lighter feature is so convenient, and the side burner is cool as well! Another plus is the grill racks and gas burners are in 3 sections not one whole piece so you can easily grill on one side for 2 people or on all 3 racks for 20 people. So it's easy to just clean up the rack that you use. If you want a combo at a lower price, go for this one!",

I take the firebox off the side and we take it camping with us and it's perfect for some burgers and hotdogs. The trick with this grill is keep it clean, i clean mine the next day after use once it's cooled off. I bought a boiler brush (stainless steel) and use it to clean the charcoal tray and wash the grills in hot soapy water and coat them with vegetable oil. if you want something to last you must take care of it and keep it clean. not just let it sit on your deck and die! My wife and kids bought me the firebox and rotisserie so i have the complete package and as long as you keep it clean and covered i will have this grill for along time to come.",

They make awesome grills and my original grill has held up great but now want the gas option also. My existing grill has been outside for 4 yrs with no cover on it and has only a little rust by the ajustable vent. Just remember when you cover a grill it is being protected from the element like the sun, rain , snow as you leave that cover on it does get moisture under it that will not dry as long as that cover is on so it is going to rust. Hope this grill is as great as my other one.",

My only request would be a one piece expanded metal or cast grille for the charcoal side instead of the 3 piece. I'm thinking of designing a chain drive hoist for the char side grille - wouldn't that be neat!

I had triple checked the measurements of the box so that I would be able to fit this in my vehicle. The closest Lowes to me was a 40 minute drive but worth it I thought for this grill. I even had my mother in law purchase the grill cover for him as a father's day gift . I drove 40 minutes on Saturday the day before father's day to pick this grill up. I walked into the Delavan Lowes location and noticed there was a grill all assembled right next to the entrance. It was the same grill I had purchased online so I decided to check in out while I waited for Customer Service to be free. There was an invoice taped to the front of the grill with my name on it and phone number and all my information. I thought to myself “there is no way THIS is MY grill”. The grill I was looking at was filthy (I have attached photos). The grill I was looking at was CLEARLY a floor model grill meant for display only. It had clearly been a grill that was brought outside daily for display. The grill I purchased online was supposed to be BRAND NEW. Also, The grill I purchased was supposed to be IN A BOX. There was no way I was fitting this assembled grill into my vehicle. I went up to customer service once they were free and spoke to them about my concerns. The gentlemen at the desk preceded to pour water from his water bottle onto a paper towel and attempt to clean the grill right in front of me. He could tell I was a little upset so he called a manage up to the front. The manager offered me a 10% discount on this grill. I was still very unhappy but my mother in law had already purchased the cover for this and my father in law was all set to give my fiancé some great steaks to grill our father's day dinner. I accepted the deal because I didn't want to be empty handed on father's day morning. Then there was a transportation issue. There was no way the grill was going to fit in my vehicle. I asked if I was able to have them deliver it for me and they said it would cost extra. I asked if they could disassemble the grill and put it back in the box and they said they no longer had the box. I had to contact my mother in law who had to drive 40 minutes herself to come and pick this grill up for me and deliver it to our house. The employees that I was speaking with acted like I was actually getting a deal because it came assemble even though that isn't what I wanted AT ALL. To say that I had a horrible experience with Lowes is an understatement. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing ANYTHING from lowes.com and definitely will not be shopping at the Delavan location.",

You can offer your freinds grilling either way they want it, gas or charcoal, at the same time, while also warming your other fixins on the side burner. If you have a large group, you can charcoal and move the cooked burgers/ribs, etc to the gas side to use as a warmer until all your food is charcoaled. The grill seems sturdy and provides significant room underneath to store supplies. The charcoal side has a bottom tray that is easily removed to clean out the used charcoal ashes.

The only improvement I have come up with so far would be to have a door under the grate level to slide my drip pan in and out of. It is awkward to have to lift the grates (3) while the meat is still present. A smarter and better chef, I use the term loosely, would be better prepared. But I still would like that feature.

The FIRST thing you need to do is READ THE DIRECTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM!Yes this will rust if:(1) you leave it uncovered and if covered a lot of mostiure gets to it(2) if you did not burn it in right the first time and(3) put vegetable oil on the inside & outside while it was still warm like the directions state!!Even if it does get a little rust on it (and it will) you can brush or lightly sand it off and paint it with heat resistant paint, then it's ok again but ask yourself this: are you cooking on the outside or the inside of the grill? Easy to control the air flow that makes cooking a breeze!! Super grill for the money well laid out design with space to spare!!!",

Regular BBQ of steaks...chicken...hamburger and such are easy to get right because this unit hold the heat and for a charcoal grill is a breeze to use! I use mesquite charcoal CHUNKS exclusively because of their heat and flavor advantage. I have found that the heavy gauge construction holds heat well, making it easier to regulate the slow/low cook temperatures required for quality smoking. I have used the gas side a few times and it works very well, but I like the \"real\" charcoal grilling best of all.

This time I bought the extended warranty and a cover that I highly recommend buying. The parts are available directly from the manufacturer and their customer service it's great. I will buy any product from this brand and I love this BBQ since u get both options and u can cook both ways, charcoal or gas, also you can use one set of grills for both side just move it side to side and you can save the other. All and all it's a great gril.. Only negative is the cover itself will last maybe 6 month in Floridas weather and it's like $40...",

Only drawback so far is that the porcelain-covered grates peeled with the first washing, although I used only water and dishsoap (no scrubbing, only soaked in water for a few minutes). Maybe they needed more oil-coating for extra protection. Be sure to fully pre-treat the grill as instructed before first use. Instructions were a bit confusing re: this process, so read carefully!!

Obviously those whose are rusting out haven't a clue how to maintain a good grill for starters the racks are made from cast iron so they are gonna rust if not properly cleaned and oiled after use. Number 2 i cant speak for the quality of the grill covers for this company but those of you who do not cover your grill or keep it out of the elements, don't expect it to last. Its natural for metals to rust especially when combined with heat and moisture (which happens when you cook) regardless of what a what a manufacture does if a grill is not properly maintained it will fall apart. take the time and effort to take care of your grill and it will last for many years.",

I would like an adjustment of the charcoal grill height to not require grill gloves; maybe a turn knob similar to other grills I've seen. Was a pain to put together (like all things assembled), but once together felt stable. This thing is big too. So probably not practical for small spaces.But, I get the best of both worlds,, charcoal and gas. Charcoal side does very well and design seems to allow air regulation properly with vent and side adjustments. Gas side has hot spots and seems to not get as hot as I would like sometimes, but may need to preheat longer. But for $250 (sale price), Spectacular!!!!",

Purchased this last year around this time because I liked the idea of having a gas grill for quick things like burgers and hotdogs, but charcoal for ribs, steak, etc. I bought it pre-assembled at Lowes so can't comment on how hard/easy it was to put together. I was impressed right away with how heavy and sturdy this is--it is thick metal, like my cast iron pans! Doubt it will ever rust out unlike many cheap (and even more expensive) grills I've had in the past. I did season it with oil as recommended in the instructions and regularly rub down the grilling sections with oil to keep it relatively non-stick (again, anyone with cast iron pans knows to do this!). It has performed wonderfully for the past year, and thanks to a mild winter in PA, I was able to grill year round. I don't have the smoker attachment, but I made a fantastic chili-rubbed smoked pork roast for the Super Bowl using indirect cooking with offset charcoal and a cast iron smoker box with hickory chips place right under the roast. (the instructions that come with the grill tell you how to cook this way) Guests said this made the best pulled pork sandwiches ever!! Both sections of the grill are large and you can fit a LOT of food on it. This grill has outperformed itself time and time again. I would recommend buying a cover to protect it from the elements. Very happy with my purchase!!!!!",

The design is well built and if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS make sure to CURE your grill according to instructions. I've never heard of doing this but it is supposed to help with RUST. That being said, the gas side lights EFFORTLESSLY with the AA battery and 3-burner ignitor. Charcoal side with added soaked mesquite or hickory (or any fruit tree) wood makes a GREAT smoker. You don't even need the side smoker if you just place your meat on one side and charcoal on the other and let smoke for an hour or two. Then you can put the meat right over the charcoal for a DELICIOUS flavorful meal!. I know this grill will rust just like the rest of them so comparing apples-to-apples, the features, versatility, quality etc. this is a great deal on a high-quality grill.",

I have a cover on this grill and it is under a small roofed area. Yes it does get wet under the area but you would think the cover would do the trick. Anyway the whole area under the burners totally rusted out and the rails that hold the grates rusted out in spots. And yes I did keep drip tray area clean. I honestly think the grill cover caused most of the surface rust on the outside of the grill because it sweat on the grill. When you take the grill cover off it would be wet from the condensation. So if you have a garage or a shed that you can store this in you probably will be good. I wish it lasted longer cause I really did like this grill.",

But for now, after reading alot of bad reviews, I have prepared my grill for hopefully a long life. So far, the grill was easy to assemble, I did add the side fire box. After seasoning the grill I cooked a brisket, ribs, and sausage. The smoker and charcoal side of the grill are great. The burner side works great. The only negative thing is the propane side, you can only use 1 burner on lowest setting to maintain 300 degrees. When I had all burners on low, the temperature was about 400 degrees. I suggest either the left or right burner on lowest setting, and cooking on the other end of the grill. I did purchase the grill cover, which I saw many negative reviews, but I purchased some Thompson's Fabric Sealer for $8, and now I believe the cover is water proof, and not weather resistant. So hopefully this will keep the grill from rusting like in past reviews.",

Both grills lasted a good time and I decided to replace them with a combo grill. My wife & I both love charcoal as well as gas. Gas is faster and easier when you have little time, where as charcoal adds flavor and is much slower. Many of the reviews that we read where good in helping us decide on buying this grill. It was very easy to assemble and the quality seems to be great. As for some of the reviews stating that there grill did not last due to rust and or deterioration, probably happened due to not maintaining the grill. You will get some rust, which is an easy fix, and if you read the manual and follow the info on how to maintain the grill it should last for years to come.

I looked and saw that my coals were done anf figured I was going to have to go to gas, but instead the burgers cooked in record time beacause of the heat holding ability of the grill. I cooked down my sauce redution on the side burner and it took me a quarter of the time that it did inside my home. This grill is worth twice the price it cost.

The quality is uncompromising, the design is simple, and everything works the way it should.I purchased the grill prebuilt and hauled it home, definitely a two person job as the grill is quite heavy.I ordered the side smoker box from Chargriller and installed it in 30 minutes. The overall length of the unit with the side smoker box is 6.5'.The grates are deep and wide, and can hold anything you can throw on them.I have owned many grills from stainless steel five burners to small charcoal hibachis but this is the one I will keep forever. Easy to work on and low maintenance.",

The thermostat was reading over 600 degrees on the lowest setting for only two burners. I could not believe it so I decided to turn off all the burners except for one and the thermostat read 400. Of course then I thought the thermostat was broken so I let it cool down completely and the thermostat was working.Thank you Lowes for printing my receipt because I had lost it. I contacted Chargriller and they told me I needed a new regulator. Now, I am waiting to hear back from them.",

Have not went through one tank of gas yet and Fire up the Chimney starter on the Side Burner. So perfect for that. I added the Side Fire Box this last year. Has been good for the Long Smoke.

The burner was handy when I needed to stoke my charcoals. Hey, it is what it is, right. Not the heaviest gauge steel & not the best smoker/grill on the market, but for the price how can you beat it. My only complaint is that the tabs that hold the flavor saver in place on the grilling side (the piece that sits over the flame) rotted away rather fast. But I made due. Just bought a new one this winter & can't wait to smoke again. One more thing the heavy duty cover also weathers rather quickly. If you want to go buy a $1000.00 Weber or Viking, be must guest but I think I'll stick with my Chargrill.",

Within the first year I started losing pieces like the smoke stack covers that were welded on and could not be reattached. 2nd although I kept the grill covered at all times of non use (I don't even want to talk about the quality of the grill covers they make) I still started seeing alot of rust show up on the body of the grill as well as the grates. The wheels are attached by plastic and with the weight of this grill that is not a good idea I lost a wheel within the first two months. The surface finish on the grates is not durable at all. I was very surprised at how quickly the finish was taken off through normal use and cleaning. They need to really work on the quality of their products.",

            "text": "I purchased this grill at Lowes after spending most of the snowy winter figuring out what to buy. I found that most (if not all) online reviews praised the design, features and versatility but indicated failure in quality. I wrote this off as improper attention to seasoning of the grill and poor care.I bought it in March 2011 and have been using it HEAVILY year 'round ever since. I also invested in the side fire box (an absolute must have for quality smoking of larger meats or large quantity of food.I have ALWAYS been a year round griller (yes even in the occasional blizzards on Long Island# and have for over a decade grilled my Thanksgiving turkey. This past year was the best ever as I decided to SMOKE the turkeys #did two small ones to cut down on overall cooking time#. Never have we had such a fantastic thanksgiving dinner.Needless to say I LOVE THIS GRILL!!!!!So here is the truth about durability - IT IS TERRIBLE. After 2 summer seasons and one off season - the grill is now rotted to the point of no longer being usable. I did in fact follow ALL directons for seasoning the entire grill and all parts, I ALWAYS kept the cover on it in bad weather and even performed additional seasonings #oilings) as the surfaces began to weather. It seems that NO MATTER what you do with this grill it is going to rot away. HOWEVER that is ok with me. Since I was concerned at the negative comments given, I bought the LOWES extended protection plan. It is now September 2012 and I have just received a gift card to Lowes for the entire purchase price of my grill INCLUDING tax. I am going tonight to buy the EXACT SAME ONE AGAIN - and of course another protection plan. I have yet to find any other grill as capabale and well made as this for the price point. So what if I have to get a new one every two years. If it costs me $39.00 extra to do so, then that is fine with me.I absolutely recommend this grill to ANYONE who is considering it - but more importantly I would HIGHLY recommend getting the protection plan to go along with it. Great job char griller AND great job to Lowes Service Advantage!",

Once put together it is very sturdy and with enough weight not afraid of it getting knock over. Love the option to use both or just one. The fact that there is a gas and charcoal side by side is great. Use Charcoal when we have plenty of time to cook and switch to the gas side when cooking time is limited. The Charcoal side is very simple but with plenty of real estate that you can even use it as a smoke if you pile the charcoal on one side and the meat on the other. The gas side is too simple I wish they would have designed the burner cover to go along the entire bottom of the cooking surface. The grease catcher is a nice feature especially how easy it is to remove the trap. Although that did not leave much room for the regular size propane tank, need to remove the grease trap in order to get the gas in or out of the bottom. The grill did come with hole with hooks to hang the utensils and the compartment in from of the charcoal grill is a great little feature.",

Done various steaks and burgers so far and even a whole turkey on the charcoal side last weekend...worked great...was easily able to control the temp at 350-400 degrees. If you are looking for a grill that is well designed and has great options at a great price I would recommend this grill. As for the longevity of the product only time will tell but if it is seasoned properly and taken care of I don't see any reason why a person couldn't get many years of use out of it.I also purchased a chimney charcoal starter and love how one can use the side burner to start the coals.

I'm wondering, how many of you complaining about the rust picked up an already assembled, displayed outside the doors of Lowes for who knows how long, grill and how many assembled their grill themselves. Also, since there is a lot of cast iron (notorious for rust), how many of those complaining know how to take care of their grill. Bottom line is, if you leave this grill outside, covered or not, then this grill is going to rust. This is simple, elementary science. For one thing, most covers are made of plastic. Plastic is prone to condensation and also will trap moisture in the air beneath the cover. If you want this grill to last, store it when not in use, keep it out of the weather. Also, if you read about cast iron cookware, or better yet, just ask your granny, cast iron has to be seasoned, and kept dry, or it will rust. This is not a new technology, this is the type of cookware our founding fathers used, but teflon has made cast iron cookware a mystery. Inform yourself before you blast the company that made it; after all, they only sell the product, it's not their job to take care of your product.",

It holds it's heat very well. I added the firebox side add-on and that worked great as well. You have to maintain your fire in order to keep the heat up..Wood seems to provide the best heat source.The temperature gauges are not very accurate, so you will need to provide your own gauge source. One you have the temp right, it will be easier and easier as time goes by.This thing will do everything except make coffee...I Love it.",

Assembly took quite some time, but once it was together it worked OK (grill grates moved around and would fall into the grill if cleaned with a brush). I wanted to replace my charcoal Weber grill with this, but found the charcoal side had too many gaps in it and the air flow/temperature was hard to control. Kept the Weber and rarely used the charcoal side. Three years later I'm now going to replace it since the main gas burners are \"rotted\" and the grill grates are rusted to the point they flake and leave metal in your food. The side burner is great for a \"charcoal chimney\" and that still works well. I didn't expect the grill to last past 5 years since that has been my experience with gas grills, but I feel this one fell apart a little too early. Great idea, so-so execution and quality.",

I also got the smoke box for it this time, but have yet to break that out of the box.

It has held up well and has sat in full sun/rain/snow without rust or anything for 3yrs. you can adjust the height of coals and/or airflow. Lots of space on the grill. can be a pain to clean compared to cast iron but not hard or a big deal. It just takes a small tool and must be cleaned one bar at a time instead of getting rough with it like on a cast iron grill. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could because I have 2 issues with it. that being said, I would buy it again today for the price!!! It is well made. Don't get me wrong, it is not one of the super thick smokers but it is nice and does everything I could wish for out of it. I use it 1-3 times per week most spring/summer/fall and about every 2-3 week in the winter.1st - the starter went out after 1 year but a new one can be ordered for just $10. I just use a match but that is me. I don't use the gas side much as I like a smoke flavor over gas.2nd - I wish it had a smoker box. So bad that I'm thinking about getting the firebox they sell at lowes that I'm told will mount to it (same brand). Nevertheless, the coals/wood chips can be lowered on one side to the point it doesn't give any direct heat and will smoke a brisket or ribs for hours!!!",

            "text": "I was very much a \"webber man\" but I really wanted the ability to do both gas and charcoal. This grill fit the bill nicely. It is not sexy, good looking or otherwise appropriate for those interested in the aesthetics of their patio. However, it is tremendously functional. On the gas side, it gets up over 500 degrees in 4 or so minutes. 700 in less than 10, which was a huge leap from my previous grill. The 3 burner density is nicer than other grills. It gives excellent temperature control. The total is grill size is a bit smaller than some other gas grills, meaning you could only do 9 burgers at once. This is not a problem as I do not have 9 people in my life I would cook for.On the charcoal side, the ability to raise an lower to charcoal is surprisingly handy. I have not installed the firebox, but I plan to so I can do some proper smoking.Side burner worked great. A new feature for me that I thought was gimmick until I started to use it regularly.The cons are: It is surprisingly hard to clean the grates and the valve for the propane tank is awfully close to the drip pan, where you could easily burn your hand.",

All things considered and for the amount of money spent.....it is still a great value. My husband does most of the daily cooking and uses the grill for dinners most of the time and year round. He is still getting used to cooking on this grill but loves the set-up so far. I didn't purchase the smoker box because we don't generally eat our meat that way but my husband would be very interested in giving it a try once he has totally adjusted to using the other sections. This grill does cook differently (hotter) than the standard style gas/charcoal grills out there. All grills truly used regularly do wear out, no matter how much money you spend on them. The trick is to care for them with regular use to extend their life. When it comes time to replace it again when all worn out a few years later......you didn't break the bank buying it in the first place!!! Very happy with the grill so far.",

With gaps between the lid and body as large as 1.5\", heat leaks out.  Which leads to needing much more fuel as well.  I spent about $100 sealing up the gaps, and got a marginal improvement at best.

Not one rust spot thus far.The grates are cast iron (which I have always preferred) and they need to be seasoned just like a cast iron frying pan and they need to be cleansed and then put a light coat of oil or bacon grease on them after use. It's virtually non stick if seasoned properly.I also read about folks having temperature control issues when smoking. So did I the first time through. The key is to use less coals and to control your dampers. I can easily maintain a 150 degree temp or hotter if I need it without a problem. This is one of the better grills IMHO.",

            "text": "I've had this grill for about 2 years now and really have enjoyed it. I like the flexibility of Charcoal when I have time, Gas when I don't have the time and both when I have a big crew over for a summer party.My only two complaints/ considerations that I will offer up for you to consider:1. With the placement of the gas tank directly under the grill, it's a little bit of a tight fit to reach under and turn off the gas. I'm of the school of turn off the gas from the tank before the knobs so it it's hot down there and just have to be careful not to burn your skin. I'd say I have average size hands so a guy with big hands may get a little frustrated.2. While I like the upper racks for general use, it has taken away my ability to make Beer Can Chicken as the placement of the rack comes across the top and won't let me close the lid without tipping it over.Other observations that I originally had concerns about based on reviews I saw when I purchased this grill:1. Rust: Is there a little interior rust in the grill? Yes, Do I season the grill as I'm supposed to? No. I'd suspect that if I was more diligent, I'd have less, but with what I do have, it's very minimal and doesn't impact performance. (Those that compare to a higher end grill at twice the price.. my mindset is that the life of 2 of these grills would be right about the same of 1 higher end grill)2. Grill Cover: My experience is that it is durable, but fades/discolors fast. It's still durable, no cuts or tears.. just discolored. It's withstood 1 Chicago winter and I have no concerns of it making it through this winter. I absolutely would recommend getting the cover and using it, but when it discolors later, remember it's about protecting your grill not the looks of the cover.I wasn't planning on grilling tonight, but now that I'm thinking about the grill, it might be time for a change in plans.",

For the first 6 months I loved it! I smoked brisket, ribs, pork shoulder and other BBQ treats (I am a Texan, so I have a legacy to uphold) every other weekend and had good success. I bought the manufacturers custom cover. Sadly, within the first year the outside was covered with rust, even with regular use of the cover. Within 18 months the metal ledge inside the gas side of the grill that hold the grates up had rusted though, making the grill unusable. I called Chargriller and found that they warranty the charcoal side of the grill body for 5 years, but the gas only 1. Both sides are made of the same material. Obviously they were aware that the materials used on the gas side were not up to snuff.I have spoken with their service department and they are nice, friendly and ultimately of no help. After they pointed out I had no warranty i said \"So, I guess I am out of luck.\" The rep said \"well, that doesnt sound very good.\" I said \"But it does describe my situation, right?\" She couldnt help but agree.Sometimes a great seeming product at a great seeming price is just too good to be true.",

            "text": "Hefty price at first but I feel I got what I paid for and Lowe's honors us vets with a military discount that was a blessing! I purchased locally about 4 years ago and later added the firebox to the side. Since the purchase I have had to replace the gas side burner covers with stainless steel adjustable covers also purchased from Lowes. I am on my second grill cover but I keep my grill/smoker on an exposed deck. The plastic knobs are my only real complaint and wish the manufacturer would use better hardware regarding this. I use this beast year round and my side of our neighborhood love the smell of this thing and even bring different hardwood over for me to use! I have read some of the complaints and would advise to take an average of the overall reviews before making a decision. I grill at minimum of 3 times a week and usually wood smoke on the weekends. I must mention that the manufacturer cautions on the heat of your fire be it charcoal or wood. if the temp exceeds 500 degrees for long periods, #bon fire#, the paint will peel after the grill cools, especially the fire box addition. Besides, smoking meat is low n slow....low temps for longer periods of time right? Keep the charcoal side and firebox, if added, oiled each time the grill is used to maintain season of grill. I love the ability to fire up the gas side during the busy week but really enjoy the feature of using the side box the cook over hardwood! some complaints exist about the sppeed this thing uses charcoal but I use kingsford just to get my wood started and use primarily wood to cook on. On occassion i have used only charcoal but the size of the grill and it not being 'air tight' allows alot of air to burn up the charcoal quickly compared to professional smokers. The side burner is excellent to get the charcoal starter fired up in a hurry and I can then dump the hot coals right into the firebox to flame up the wood. We have smoked and roasted pork, chicken, beef, salmon, seafood, and venison all perfectly! I will caution to keep some spray oil, like Pam, handy to keep all exposed parts sprayed and wiped down religiously. Keep ashes dumped as soon as they cool, and dump the drip pans. These simple steps will aid in keeping your investment in good working condition. in the past 10 years here in TN I have replaced some nice gas grills, the last one a stainless 4 burner. This gas/wood/smoker is by far my favorite and most reliable grill. If you need something better I would advise building your own. good luck with that!",

The combination of gas and charcoal, especially with the firebox on the side provides the greatest versatility in a single grill that I have yet seen. I could go on and on about the fantastic meals I have prepared for family and friends but that will just make me hungry,The biggest problem with this grill are the cheap grade of materials it is constructed with. On the one hand it is what makes the price tag so affordable, but on the other you will be shelling out that same amount every 3 years to replace this thing as it falls apart from rust. It doesn't really matter if you cover this thing or not - it will rust and it will break. Honestly, I would rather pay 2-3 times the amount and have this thing last 10 years.I suppose you could keep your eyes peeled for when this goes on sale at Lowe's (it drops by $100.00 once a year sometime in the spring) but I really don't see that as a good long term option. Pity, as I loved this grill for the first couple of years.Reviews that say High Quality and Durable are not accurate - those folks just haven't owned this grill long enough.",

            "text": "We got this grill a couple months ago, so I can only comment on my experience up to this point. I am extremely pleased with the grill for the price. I assembled it myself in about 3 hours (it was actually a lot easier to assemble than other grills I have owned). We didn't run into any problems with the assembly. The assembled unit feels very solid. As others have said, the wheels must have been upgraded recently because they are a very sturdy rubber. I love cooking on the grill. I have not had any problems with the gas side being too hot as others have. I'll generally sear my steaks on a high setting with the lid up, and then drop the burners down to low and close the lid. We don't have any problem keeping the temp around 375. The charcoal side (as others have said) is amazing. We don't have the smoker box, and probably will not add one since we can smoke in the charcoal side as it is now (coals/wood on one side/ water pan on the other). For the average person, that leaves enough room to smoke up plenty of meat for a party.I can't comment on the rust issues others have since we've only had the grill about a couple months. What I can say is that every grill will have rust issues eventually, and those issues will be a lot worse a lot faster if you don't take care of your grill. After assembly, I seasoned both sides of the grill by coating all the inside surfaces with vegetable oil spray and heating both units up to about 400 degress for a few hours. I also rubbed vegetable oil on the outside of the grill chambers while it was heating up. Be sure to put a large piece of cardboard under the grill when you do this if you want to protect your floor from the oil that will drip off. With either side, you need to keep the inside of the grill relatively clean and free of build up. The gas side is very easy to clean up after use. The grates and burner shields come right out without any screws or anything. Scrape those off and wash the shields if needed in your kitchen sink. There is plenty of room to clean the bottom around the burners, also. This doesn't need to be done every time, but I don't think a lot of people EVER really clean anything but the cooking grates. Do that every so often, and spray the inside and outside surfaces with vegetable oil again to coat it all and get it reseasoned (all surfaces, even on top and under the 'lip' that holds the grates (that people say rusts out on this model). Do those things, and I don't see why this grill won't last for many years. If you don't keep it clean, it will rust out, just like the most expensive models.",

            "text": "I bought this grill in early 2009 because my old charcoal grill fell apart from years of use. The grill has held up well over the years with minimal upkeep in the heat and humidity of Eastern North Carolina. The cover worked well for 5 months of the 2009 summer while I was away, but as soon as I was back I was back to grilling. I have rarely used the cover since. The grill has rusted some as mentioned in other posted, the gas bottom of the barrel, the tank stand, etc, but it is not as bad as some others have mentioned, especially being uncovered for almost 2 years surviving hurricanes, and snow in the winters. I plan on purchasing another one in the future when this one finally kicks the bucket. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes the convenience of gas, but truly loves to cook with charcoal. For the next one I will break out the grill, cover it in high temp spray paint prior to assembly to assist in making it last.",

I have thoroughly enjoyed my grill, utilizing both sides (but mainly the propane). when I bought mine I paid the $300 listed here.Two months later they had a Memorial Day sale where they discounted it to $200! What a steal that would have been. I bought one at that price as a gift to my son and he loves his, too. But, it was worth the $300 I paid. If they happen to toss out another deal like that ($200) for the summer I WILL buy another one and store it in the rafters for when the one I have takes a dump! that's how much I like mine.I use mine on average of twice a month, more so in the Spring and Summer of course. For me it has plenty of cooking space. It has held up well, albeit I heard about the negative reviews regarding the brand cover that is assigned to it. I purchased a heavier duty cover, which fits perfectly over it, and it too has l lasted (so far), but the harsh Temecula summers have been beating it down (mostly faded) so I expect the need to buy another one after this season. The burners have not fouled up on me, it heats up quickly, and it disperses the heat well (although like another reviewer stated yo need to only use one burner for lower temp jobs) overall. I have only used the side burner twice. that was an added feature I knew I would rarely use when I bought it.Negatives: The small interior elevated rack, which I rarely use, seems to have taken a beating from the heat generated. Still is functional, but need to give it a good scraping / cleaning before I use it again.GAs for rust - I see two small area down at the legs, which are exposed. No big deal... I plan to steel wool it down and spray it with some Rustoleum.I give this grill two thumbs up!",

I was very excited about the possibilites until I read the review of that particular grill. Almost gave up on the idea until I saw this grill at Lowes. The reviews were great, it came highly recommended by the sale's guy (which isn't saying much, but still), and I haven't been disappointed since we bought it.I love the combination of quick grilling with gas when time is a factor and the more time consuming but more flavorful grilling with charcoal when I have more time. I've used both sides several times now, following the directions for treating the interior of the grill with vegetable oil, and have not noticed any problems. I got the grill cover and have been very pleased with how it fits and is easily put on and taken off. I appreciate that in the future I can invest in the charcoal chimney and smoke box, both of which are made by Char-Grill and are said to be easily attached to the grill (plus the grill cover expands to cover the smoke box, which is nice).The grill is heavy, but I had the grill pre-assembled and delivered, at the time both free, which saved on the trouble of moving this beast of a grill. I plan to store it in the garage during the winter to avoid exposure to the MN winters, so the weight will only come into play twice a year.",

He also urged me to read and follow the page in the Owner's Manual regarding grill preparation. That procedure is similar to seasoning a cast iron skillet to prevent rust. I'll do my part - let's see if it works.",

            "text": "The best concept to hit the market in my opinion. Gas convenience during the week smoker on the weekends! The gas side serves as a grate cleaner also, so when you want to smoke something, I simply cook off the gunk on the gas side and then place the grates from the gas side to the char/smoker side. I rotate the grates in this manor. Love the grill concept.My grill when I bought it had some slight workmanship issues. The ash pan for the offset smoker box had a gap on one side when fully closed and there was a slight dent in one of the bottom bbq pit halves which was not a big deal, but a bit of an eye sore. The temp gauges were pretty accurate. Personally I would have liked to have seen the bottom shelf made out of aluminum vs. steel because mine rusted out after 3 years. Once it starts, it won't stop. My advice is to use veggie oil on the paint every few months keep the grill lasting, it really does help. I wish I would have done it more often than I did but you learn the hard way sometimes. Best thing to do is get a pray bottle, fill it with veggie oil, and then spray down everything letting it soak into the paint. Using a paper towel wipe away any excess.Great starter smoker/grill but you may find two dedicated grills, one smoker plus one gas grill a better option after you gain some experience. I would recommend this grill but it could benefit from some minor improvements.",

I purchased the cover and keep it covered whenever not in use. I have had to replace the flame deflectors on the gas side which is expected (they take a beating) and also replaced the striker -all parts can be ordered directly from Char-Griller.This is a great grill for any type of cooking you wish to do, very heavy gauge steel unlike other brands.

            "text": "I bought the grill 2 years ago or so and I was so excited to buy it when I saw the large grilling area, the fact that you could do propane on one side & charcoal on the other. I bought it without doing any research or reading the reviews, but I thought it would be an upgrade to my smaller existing propane grill (and I wanted to do more charcoal grilling).Along with the grill, I bought the custom cover. The cover is not good quality & I didn't like how it is just \"weather resistant\" rather than water proof. After a very short period of time, I found that the grill was starting to rust, more so on the propane side rather than the charcoal side. I live in the pacific northwest, so I assumed that with the amount of rain that we get, the grill wasn't suited to our wet weather. I am surprised to see how many others around the countrly are having the same issues that I am with rust.As for the grill itself, I did like how hot the propane side got in such a short time, but did notice some paint discoloration, as well as the thermometer stopped working at the end of the season. I didn't like that the uppper warming racks are stationary and cannot be taken off the BBQ. My old BBQ had a place where the warming rack would sit, and if you decided to do so, you could lift it off with ease before or during your grilling. I like to grill a Beer Butt Chicken, which requires the chicken to sit upright on the beer can. With the warming rack on the grill, it made it next to impossible to do so. On the other hand, I like to have the option of the warming rack if I am making a Garlic bread or baked potato on the grill...so it would have been nice to have a removable rack rather than one that gets screwed on during assembly.The grill worked really well for the first summer I had it. After the summer I put the cover on it & stored it on a covered area of my patio, but it still got really rusted. I also had issues with the flame being way too low after re-filling the propane bottle and in turn had to play around with the propane regulator & have it sit in a specific position for the flame to be on at a reasonable level & create decent heat. Most recently, one of the grill knobs on the propane side has seized up & I thnk I may have to start using pliers to turn it on and off.Two years in, I regret buying this grill. I think next time around, I will spend more to get a quality grill rather than less on the cool idea of having a grill that can be propane or charcoal.",

            "text": "I am a twelve month BBQ user. We have had a monster Stainless grill for the last 9 years and have cooked pretty much everything including the annual thanksgiving turkey. Decided this year it was time for a new grill but didn't want just another boring SS monster. Did some looking on the web and found this char-griller with great reviews - and for the price at lowes (pre-assembled no less) I figured I would give it a shot. I also got the side firebox (though I didn't set it up for a week - silly mistake, what a difference).When I got it home, I went through and tightened up all of the hardware fasteners, which was much better than having to actually build the whole thing from parts. I then read ALL of the direction and followed them very specifically including the all important seasoning phase. It is a good idea to buy this AFTER dinner so you are not tempted to jump right in to cooking on it as you will be disappointed if the seasoning step is skipped. I have since used this grill at least 20 of the last 30 days both gas and charcoal sides.Setup and installed the firebox the second weekend and WHAT AN AWESOME ADD ON!!! We had some people over for a mini BBW party (yes seems strange in mid March). We smoked a rack of spare ribs for dinner all day on the charcoal side while grilling up burgers and dogs for lunch for the kids on the gas side.I wanted to also comment on the convenience of lighting charcoal using a chimney and the side burner. I have watched my father with his old Weber kettle grill for years - lighting the charcoal with one of those U shaped electric lighters. This was the biggest reason why I bought a gas grll to start with. Using a charcoal chimney in conjunction with the gas side burner makes charcoal grilling as easy as gas cooking and SO MUCH TASTIER!!!Make sure you get the custom made cover too (which is made to accomodate the side firebox also). Worth the price!I also decided at just about the one month point to go back and get the extended protection plan. Skipped it at first based on the low price, but now appreciate what a great BBQ this is a want to keep it around for many years. (4 yrs additional for only $60)In closing this is a great grill at a great price that can be picked up locally with no assembly charge. Thank you Char Griller and thank you Lowes!!!",

I picked up the firebox and cover as well.I had it together in about two hours by myself even though the instructions recommended two people. The wheels, which a lot of folks complained about were beefier and must have been upgraded. There was no \"knocking\" or drilling out the channel from firebox to charcoal sections, all I had to do was remove some screws and a plate.I can pick it up with the handle on the firebox and there isn't that much play or flexing as was reported in some earlier reviews, and is fine for me moving it around the area I use it in for mowing and so forth. It is heavy!I have used it almost every day...all sides, gas, charcoal, and firebox, with no rust or problems. I do keep it liberally coated with pam, burn it off (the grill racks) after each use, get rid of ash in the firebox as it can attract moisture, and like I said, no rust problems. It has been rained on...although with the cover on over the weeks as we've been experiencing a high incidence of thunder storms and high humidity in our area of the Pacific Northwest, which is unusual, and I'm not going to move it every time the clouds roll in but this weather hasn't promoted any rust.I've done (smoked) pork roasts/chops, several briskets, and chicken using the firebox and all turned out excellent and it held a constant 248 degrees on both apple wood and mesquite fires. This is with the chimney vent cracked and I like to smoke at the higher end temp, but the 225 to 250 range is ideal. No problems there. A rule of thumb, if the smoke is white, the fire's right! I can get pretty consistent temp control using both the gas and charcoal sides as well. I don't know what an earlier review is doing wrong.Overall, this is the best grill I have ever owned! If you want to experience true BBQ in the south east and Texas styles without spending thousands, then I'd get this grill!Tonight we are having spare ribs cooked on the gas side, and I don't expect anything but a delicious experience!",

            "text": "I have to agree with smokinforfun, this grill is indeed \"freakin' awesome\" ! His review is what swayed me to finally decide on this grill. I was replacing a Weber, and was steering towards getting another one. However, my father insisted on gifting me a new grill of my choice, with $$ not being an issue. That being said, I shopped around to try and find the best deal. I knew what I had in mind, but felt guilty looking at the $800 grill I had my eye on. I am so glad it worked out the way it did. I never knew this grill existed, and I had planned on purchasing a a charcoal grill later in the season. When I saw this grill I feel in love. When I saw the price and the reviews from real people, it was sold.I have had it for only a month, but have cooked every meal on it since it arrived. I have used the charcoal side much more than the gas. Some of the reviews suggest that after 6 uses rust begins, I have used it about 30 times, maybe more. I will fire up the gas side to cook a quick lunch for my son and his friends when they are in the pool. NO RUST. I have cleaned it many times, because of the high usage. I have the custom cover, which is heavier and more durable than my Weber one was. It was only $30(reg. price) vs. the $80 Weber(sale price mind you). So, I do not understand how the cover did not work for the other people. Just like, smokinforfun, I plan on getting the smoke box.The only problem I had was with assembly. I had it assembled at the store. The lids were put on backwards, and the middle gas burner was not connected. In the matter of a 10 minute phone call, I had a brand new grill and 10% refund promise. 2 days later the new grill was delivered, the old one removed. That afternoon I went to my local store and got my refund, no questions asked. Kudos to Rob, manager at the Vineland, NJ Lowes. The service I received with this transaction made me a loyal Lowes customer forever. We are in the midst of several home updates, so I will be visiting Lowes a lot in the near future",

I am a \"low & slow\" griller, mostly cooking on low heat (250-300 degrees). The Char Griller, on low heat, exceeded 500 degrees when cooking with propane. I bought another thermometer just to verify the temp, and tried switching to a different gas bottle. I loved the grill and concept, and really wanted this thing to be satisfactory. But there is no way I can live with a grill that can't cook below 500 degrees, especially when the company recommends against cooking at that high of a temp. I emailed the company twice with no response. So....I hauled the grill back to Lowes tonight, broken hearted.",

There is nothing fancy about the thing, but it can cook.I have primarily done propane cooking for quick food preparation in the evenings when the kids and wife are hungry. Immediately you will notice it is solidly built. The thing heats up quick and it is easy to maintain a steady temp. I like the fact the lids(s) actual wrap around the bottom half to kind of seal the cooking area. The warming rack is well sized and can hold a good deal of whatever you may be cooking; as others have said the warming rack should have a small lip on the back. Cooking with coal is similar all be it a bit slower initially than the propane, but it works really well. The adjustable coal rack is a useful/good feature. Again, plenty of cooking space.Pros:Heats FastSteady Temp MaintenancePlenty of cooking roomSide burner (good for heating up coal in a coal chimney)Cons:No back lip on the warming rack",

Having the ability to use gas or charcoal is obviously the selling point here. If I have extra time for dinner, I use charcoal. If I need to cook something faster, I'll use gas. I have also used the charcoal side on many occasions for smoking meat. It is fantastic. I eventually purchased the side firebox and love that also. It allows for the entire charcoal side to be used for smoking rather than just the center portion when using the \"water-pan smoking\" method.I've been using it for over 2 years now and constantly recommend it to people. When this thing finally does need to be replaced, I will likely buy the exact same one to replace it with.Cons: It is a large grill with heavy components. It took a while to put together and I would recommend 2 people rather than 1. I did it myself but it would have been much easier if I had someone to help. The components will rust but if you use vegetable oil spray (as the manual recommends) to coat the outside and inside it will make the grill last much longer.",

All I can say is that, yes it does rust, what doesnt, and the ignitor switch or plunger however you want to say it to start the gas side stoped working soon after it was bought new, maybe in a few months, and the Heat Shields finialy started to fall of thier suports cause of the rust deteriation of the metel just this 1st part of this year 2012 and the best part is, not for me anyways, is that all the time I have had this grill for the past 5 years stright, I NEVER HAD IT COVERED! and it was always left to the Elements outside, so I think I can write this review being Unbias and because of maybe my lack of stupidity and the unavailbilty of being able to purchase a cover to fit it, till they finialy came out, since I also had added the Fire Box (smoker) to it. I will aslo note and agree with everyone else, the wheels and axles need some attention. After a while those plastic wheels start deteriating and wont want to support the weight of that mosterous BBQ Grill when its time to move it around after about maybe 4 years. The axles are just short enough to reach from side to side of bottom frame so adding other type of wheels wich I recomend later will aso require an longer steel axle. Other than this I cannot complain. I will be however buying a cover this time for my new one and I bet it lasts Alot longer than 5 years. I just wished it was a 4 burner though.",

I really like the small grill plates which make them easy to move around, the adjustable charcoal tray for ease of adjusting height and easy cleaning.

The issue I am having is that even on low, the gas side is running at 450 degrees plus. I have reset the Regulator but it has not helped. I have read the FAQ which was no help. I have tried to use the website and do a support ticket, no help. If anyone has had the same problem and has a solution I would appreciate it.",

In my case, the fire grate/ash pan on the charcoal side turns out to be defective. On one trial only, two of its six welding points have alreday broken off. I tried to contact the manufacture by phone and email but their customer service appears to be just for the show. No one has responded yet. I called Lowe's whose customer service filed a report and non-commitally promised to (maybe) exchange the part.I am crossing my fingers now hoping something will happen.Make sure you give it a good scrub during your 30 day trial. Hualing and dismantling this 150 lbs locomotive surely is a lot of fun as well.",

After one year of use my grill still looks brand new! My only complaint (and it is a minor complaint) is the position of the propane tank in relation to the drip pan. It does make changing the tank a little bit of a pain if you're in the middle of cooking due to the heat of the drip pan being so close to the tank. But if you use hot mitts to change the tank (or better yet make sure you have enough fuel to finish the job before you start) it's really not that big of a deal. As far as the wood/charcoal/smoker side, absolutely no complaints from me. I can dial in from 190 to 650 degrees with the air inlet and outlets depending on what I am cooking and keep the temp consistent throughout. If you like to cook with either propane or wood/charcoal, this IS the grill for you!",

We use a grill almost every day in the summer and keep it covered, but they seem to have a lifespan of about 3-4 years in this price range. I saw the duo and it looked like a really great buy, about the same as the Char Broiler that I had, Plus it has the charcoal option and the side burner. Seems sturdy too. So far I love it. Cooks great, nice and even. Lights right away. Grates are pretty easy to clean. The big question is, how long is it going to last? I guess we'll see. I did buy the cover that goes with it since it is an odd size and has the stacks. It is quite large and very heavy. One snafu during assembly the holes in the bottom of the gas side for the bolts that hold the grease tray, were drilled wrong. They were reversed! The ones that were on the left, were on the right and vice versa. Since most of the grill was assembled at that point and I didn't want to have to wait for a part from the manufacturer, I just re-drilled the holes. Hopefully for the sake of others, that was just a rare manufacturing error. I didn't find anyone report the same issue.",

            "text": "I've had this grill for going on five years. I also bought the side firebox for smoking. There is very little that I would change about this grill. It's nearly perfect.One thing I would change is that there should be a way to utilize both sides of the grill (gas and charcoal) at the same time when you are smoking meat. Being able to combine the two sides would be handy for indirect cooking and keeping things warm too.A few people are complaining about these grills rusting. Mine has rusted, but not significantly. It has been outside for five years so you have to expect a little rust I guess. I notice that the gas side rusts more than the charcoal side. I'm not sure why, but there seems to be something about the chemistry of the propane flame that encourages rust. In any case, I find that the people who complain about rust the most also seem to be the ones that talk about thoroughly cleaning the grill after each use. I think you need to let the grease kind of coat the metal to help keep it from rusting. I think you really have to treat this grill like a good cast iron pan. One thing I did do was cover the entire grill (inside and out) with vegetable oil after I put it together then let it get good and hot to \"season\" the metal parts of the grill. Since then, I clean out the charcoal ashes (they'll hold moisture) and kind of wipe off any kind of barbecue sauces (they tend to be acidic) and let the \"grease\" stay in place. I think a lot of my success with avoiding rust is to never clean off that protective layer.Anyhow, this is a great grill. I'd buy another one in a minute...when I have to. I need to think about getting some new heat shields for the gas burners as they've pretty much seen their day and the warming grates have rusted, but they're not very useful anyhow and a little rust doesn't hurt anyhow. There's some of the black pain that has come off of the side firebox (I think due to pretty extreme heat) so I need to hit that area with a wire brush and a little high temperature paint.Buy this grill...but don't scrub it down and remove all the grease and oils between uses. Season it like a cast iron pan and treat it like a cooking tool and you won't be disappointed.",

The side burner is great for starting a chimney of charcoal up. I also use the side burner to make beans and corn. I was surprised that the propane is quiet. I will be buying the firebox soon that attaches to the side of the charcoal grill so I can smoke a lot of different foods. The only flaw I see is that the smoke comes out a little where the hood of the grill closes. It's a easy fix to seal it off properly. I highly recommend this grill.",

The black finish is reminiscent of the grills serious BBQ enthusiasts use- not like the shiny chrome pieces we've seen elsewhere for twice the price. We had a large family party on Father's Day, and my husband grilled boneless/skinless chicken thighs and hotdogs on the propane side, while slow-cooking pork ribs and burgers on the charcoal side. My family raved about the taste. The only two things we purchased that I wish had come with was a charcoal starter (which you can start on the propane burner- AWESOME), and ceramic briquettes for the gas side.",

The grill cover didn't even make it for 1 year and the material basically turned off white in color.  The firebox attachment has a wooden handle on it.  When you use it, it starts to sap and you can't even touch the handle without burning yourself.  The one temperature on the smoker side has already stopped working.  There is also no way to control the temperature of the smoker.  The components of the grill side have already wore through and have started to fall apart.  I had a weber grill for over 16 years with the cover and only had to replace the burner and covers 1 time.  Like I stated, I have only had this grill/smoker combo for 2 years and I am already going to have to replace the components of the grill.  I like two things only, the size of both the smoker and the grill and the quick lighting of the grill.  Never had an issue with lighting it, well yet anyway.",

Call it the best of both worlds. So far I have been happy with it and would choose to purchase it again if need be. Assembly is pretty straight forward although it does scratch easily during the process. The storage space below is adequate at best but the shelf reduces the that. Also the box is very heavy and large so you certainly need two people to move it; be careful however because the box is poorly made and everything fell out the bottom when I was moving it to the assembly area I had chosen. This unit also has an addable smoker which I like for its expansion capability. Price of this item is substantially more than other options but those are either gas or barbecue, not both. Lastly it is much bigger than other bbq options so plan the space accordingly, especially if you choose to add the smoker unit at any point.",

But there are precautionary measures that can be taken to prevent this, and sometimes, it's just going to happen! The performance, cooking space, heat distribution of this grill is phenomenal. Does the job exactly how I would want a grill to do. IF you are worried about such a grill not lasting, or rusting, just research how to help prevent it as best you can in the long run, and you will enjoy the grill to it's full potential.

            "text": "I read a lot of the reviews here before purchasing this grill. To me it was easily assembled and the instructions were clear-cut and linear in their approach. The only complaint I have about the instructions is that there are conflicting points about how to season it before use. Recommended seasoning in one place recommends a max of 250 degrees for two hours and in another is says use high temp for the gas section. WD-40 is recommended to remove remaining glue from affixed placards; this did not work for me. Instead, I used \"Goo-Gone\" with good results. Sure would have been nice to use stainless fasteners, at least on the small screws that retain the burners. Thus far I've had a hard time keeping the charcoal side down below 400 degrees, even with the damper shut. As some others have commented, sealing or at least minimizing the gap at the back of the top and bottom housing might help in that regard. The side burner works great to light off a charcoal chimney and I've found that the capacity of charcoal held in one of these devices is about right for this grill. The burner tubes for the gas side burn nice and even, providing balanced heat control. I'll have to wait and see about the tabs and burner shields that some have expressed concern about here. One thing going in I didn't like is the wheel configuration. For smaller areas, you have to pull and swing to maneuver this behemoth where you want it, requiring a good amount of muscle and a switching engine from the local rail yard. I'm going to retrofit mine with casters so it can simply be pushed or pulled from its parking area on my deck. Overall, so far, so good.",

I've had a propane grill for about 10 years and never liked it much simply because you just cannot beat the flavor of charcoaled cooking. However, propane has its upside and there's no denying that it's much quicker to flame up the propane than to wait for the charcoal to get ready. So, I've now got the best of both worlds! It took me about 2 hours to put together and it looks fantastic! I've used the charcoal side (awesome experience, easy cleanup) and the heating plate. The heating plate just fired up so easily that it almost scared me when I turned it on...seriously...I jumped and laughed at myself when I did. Didn't expect the \"pop\" that started it right up. The burners on the propane side fire up just as easily and I just love this thing so far. Time will tell how well it stands up to weather and use, but the cover should help extend its life.",

The Heat from the coals are what make a perfect product, wrong temp, it never comes out quit right. With the ajustable coal rack you are able to move them at what distance you need in a matter of seconds. All of a sudden the Kids and grandkids show up and want a quick meal with you, well, being the char coal side of the is just about out and no room left, we can quickly open the gas side of the grill and throw on what ever we can dig out of freezer or have someone run down the street and pick up burgers and dogs, walla, everyone is eating dinner without much of a big problem. I believe you call that convienence, and Grandpa or Dad saves the day. The only way this grill could be better is that if insted of a pot grill it is changed to a griddle type grill. Somehow saving some room from the grills and adding the room to the burner area to ENLARGE a griddle area, OMG that would make it perfect. I HAVE NOT seen a grill with a griddle incorparated into it. I have seen large self supporting griddles but not built in with a BBQ grill, WORK on that design and you will have a larger peice of the market, ALOT of people would love a griddle incorparated into there grill, and not one you have to add or take apart everytime you want to use it. I would pay a bit more for the hudge improvement on the griddle.The quality is fantastic, i let mine cool down a bit and then throw my cover on it and there is not the slightest hint of rust anywhere and I live in and around the water in Cocoa beach.",

            "text": "This grill is a must have! When it comes to buying things I love to research and read reviews before i commit to buying something. Couldn't decide on whether to buy a gas or charcoal grill but after seeing the reviews for this grill i finally decided to buy it (at the original $300 price). Now about 1.5 yrs later I am so happy with it that I plan on getting one this week for my parents since it is on sale for only $200 (insane price to pass up).The grill is great quality and quite a jaw dropper with its impressive smoke stacks and size to all that see it during my many back-yard cookouts. I love using natural wood lump charcoal to get the great taste of wood fired BBQ and lighting the charcoal couldn't be easier when using a starter chimeny ($15) and the side burner (only takes a few mins to get the wood lit) However, I can't stress enough how great it is to have a gas grill as well. What a truely brilliant idea to have both methods of cooking on the same grill. When i'm cooking for only myself or when i'm in a hurry I use the gas instead. No need for a second bulky grill around. Yet when having a party i put both sides running to get an amazing 1040 sq inches of grilling surface. My guests can't eat fast enough to run out of food!!I also purchased the smoker side box which is also great quality and very easy to use. The temperature while smoking meats is much easier to control than i had first imagined. Also, the temp doesn't drop much when opening the hatch to add charcoal or smoker chips do to the indirect setup.The only cons i have is that the cover fits rather loosely and tends to come off or rip during very windy days. Now i keep a small 2X4 on it to keep it from flying into the neighbor's yard if i forgot to take it off. Also, the handles to raise and lower the charcoal grate should have been made of something that doesn't get as hot. Since temperature on charcoal grilling is controled not only with the vents but also by the height of the grate, i find it a bit annoying to have to grab rags or oven gloves in order to grab the handles to raise/lower it (due to the metal being extremely hot to the touch). Very big and hard to move around once the side smoker box is attached. Could use a 2nd set of wheels rather than having to lift one end to move it. But then again how often do you have to move your grill? (def not a tailgating grill) The rest of the grill is amazing and with a 5yr warranty against rust and availablity to order parts online directly from the company; you can't go wrong. That is if you ever even need to :)",

            "text": "I can't say enough good about this grill.  Live in Central Florida.  Use the grill at least 3-5 times a week.  LOVE IT!  I've read the rust issues, and I have to wonder how many of those inexperienced grillers are seasoning their meats and veggies with salt \"during\" the cooking process, which places salt directly on the metal parts.  We all know what salt does to steel, in a moist environment such as the inside of a grill.  Obviously, one should season whatever it is they are cooking, before or after cooking on the grill.  Before I found this unit, I was going through grills every 10-12 months.  We really give them a work-out. We keep the grill on a back porch, w/o a custom cover.  I'm not crazy about covers, because they tend to lock moisture inside the grill.  Also, I've found the Char-Griller inside customer service representative, on the phone, to be extremely responsive when I needed a small replacement part.On a third note, MANY people don't know how to cook and maintain the older \"cast iron\" grill cook surfaces.  NEVER use soap on cast iron.  Clean, if needed, then oil the entire surface, top and bottom, to reduce possibility of rust.  THANK YOU CHAR-GRILLER, FOR A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT!!!!  (No, I don't work for Lowe's or Char-Griller...lol)",

I still smoke on it but the rust makes using the gas side very unappealing, The side burner is rusted out, the heat shield brackets have all rusted away. The entire grill is faded rusted and hardly looks like a place you want your food format this point. The bad news is, I love this grill because it was all in one space and my wife could cook easily. OUT of the box this thing is a five star review, after a few months your stars will likely drop to a one as well as there is no value in saving money if the product only last one good year and then starts to deteriorate.

            "text": "I have owned this grill now for 2 years and I have to say that I like it, but it does have a few flaws. We'll start with those.The first problem was with the propane gas fitting. Recently, the brass nipple that creates the seal with the tank valve inside the plastic nut developed a radial crack. This resulted in gas leaking between the fitting and the tank's valve, making a noticeable hissing noise. I contacted the manufacturer and they informed me that the propane parts only have a 1 year warranty, so I would have to pay $25 + S&H for a replacement regulator. I went to a local hardware store for a replacement propane acme nut instead. Replacement was easy enough, just disappointing that they don't stand behind such an important part for long. BTW, the part was never attached more than hand tight considering the nut is plastic.The second is the sealing of the charcoal side. As other people have mentioned, there is a gap along the edge of the charcoal side, making control of the temp rather difficult/limited. That being said, it tends to stay around where I want it without much effort all on its own. Trying to smother the charcoal is pretty much impossible. Closing all of the vents just makes it burn slower until all the coals are dust.Rust has been an issue with the grill, though I do have the fitted cover for the grill to help protect it. The only parts that are showing some rust are the bottom shelf, the heat spreaders above the burners, drip trays and the side burner head. I hoped the cover would stop this altogether, but I noticed that the cover does allow water in through the seams. The body of the grill has not shown any rust yet.As for the pros of the grill:Convenient to have both gas and charcoal.Ceramic coated grates are thick and easy to clean.Electronic igniters work very well.Side burner works great with charcoal chimney startersHuge cooking area if you fire up both sides at once.In conclusion, I do like the grill, but the flaws of the grill mean I can't recommend it. To be honest, if you want both charcoal and gas, just buy one of each and sit them side by side. It will probably cost about the same, but then you can move each around independently and if one needs replacement, you don't lose both.",

Also the heat shields started disintegrating. July 2015 I finally put the gas grill out of its misery. I got 7 years out of this grill! I removed the gas grill leaving the wood grill and firebox on the frame. I am going to build some kind of work top on the frame where the gas grill was. I sanded the rust off the frame and wood pit and will paint it tomorrow. I expect to get at least 5 more years out of the BBQ side, probably more if I maintain it like I should. This grill was NOT maintained at all. I seasoned it when it was new. Other than that it sat in the elements of central Texas under a cedar tree. It was easy to use. Most of the time I cooked using one or two burners. Very rarely were all three on at the same time. Does great steaks and burgers. The smoker I use for brisket, pork butt and turkey at Thanksgiving. Using oak, I can maintain 200-225 for hours while checking every 30-45 minutes.Oh yeah, ordered another CharGriller gas grill from Lowes. Can't beat it.",

            "text": "Hi - I have had this grill for 3 years and have had many problems. Just like you could imagine, I was super excited for a grill that could cook both gas and charcoal because on the weeknights after work, I don't have the time for charcoal but on the weekends, nothing beats the taste of a slowly grilled steack over charcoal. Well, the first problem that I noticed is that you cannot leave the propane tank open on this grill and expect to still have gas in the tank ( I know for safety reasons you shouldn't do this and maybe its more common than not, but my old grill was great for this#. I first used this grill for Easter, and we cooked the appetizers around 1:00, then shut down the grill #but didn't close the propane tank# while we prepped the main course. At about 3:00, I went to start the grill back up but it wouldn't start because there was no gas left in the tank. It was a full tank when we started, and so I had to run out to get a new tank on Easter and push back dinner by an hour and a half. The next problem that I had was the hardware on just about everything was completely rusted by the second season #and yes, I had the customer grill cover on the grill at all times that it was not in use). The handle to the gas grill fell off because the nuts rusted off and the top vent plate fell off because the hardware also rusted through. The temperature gauge on the gas grill also fell off but I'm not sure if it was rust related or just poor quality. In the second season of this grill, after discovering that the hardware was of poor quality and falling apart, I noticed that my temperature lever on the right hand side was no longer increasing/decreasing the heat when I turned it. I eventually removed the lever and discovered that the inside was stripped so the small plastic peice that used to sit in the metal device to turn the grill temp up or down had broken off and so the third burner would now have to be turned with a screw driver. Well, now the curb appeal of my once awesome grill was missing a knob, a temperature gauge, a handle and the top vent cover. My final problem was the straw that broke the cammels back. At the start of my third season, I can now no longer get the temperature above 300 degrees. I just got a new propane tank and the grill started up without problem. I had flames on all three burners, but I couldn't get the temperature any higher than 300. I tried everything in my power to get this thing cooking without luck. I used to have a grill that lasted for 8 years, never a problem with it besides old age. This grill leaves a lot to be desired, lacks any kind of quality, and doesn't hold up with the competition. I will never purchase another grill by this company after my experience with this one. I'd rather cook over an open fire in the back yard.",

If you plan to give your grill hard use and expect that some replacement parts will be required to keep it usable for a number of years, this is a serious drawback to this product.",

We've had the Duo for nearly six months and it gets used at minimum 4 nights a week if not more! In fact it is so easy to use and cooks so well that we probably do more cooking outside on the Duo than we do in our kitchen. The side fire box attachment is a great add on that produces great smoked BBQ!The only issue I have with the grill is the design on the gas side. The bottom of the grill has a large drip pan that can be removed for cleaning, but the bottom of the gas side can't be removed for cleaning like other gas grills that have a pull-out bottom. Not a real problem in the big picture.Do follow the directions and correctly season the grill prior to use! This will protect it against rust.",

            "text": "This really is a good product.  Read the directions and follow manufacturer's recommendations.  In the directions, it is specifically stated that this grill must be seasoned before use.  That will help prevent rust.  In addition, constant maintenance is also key.  Clean it.  Occasionally, re-apply some vegetable oil.  The burner will need to be ground and re-painted with high-temp Rustoleum on occasion, because the heat removes the paint and it will rust.  It's simple: take care of your stuff.  Cover it when not in use to keep the rain/snow off.  Thoroughly clean and re-season it at least twice a season, more if you use it a lot.  Get the side fire box as well to get the full effect of this thing.  It really is versatile.There are some videos out there of some mods done such as adding stove gasket and RTV sealant, adding dryer vent to the charcoal side chimney to lower the chimney to grate level, installing baffles & fire brick for smoking/heat control and adding additional grate-level thermometers.  I'll be trying some of those this coming season.In general, this is really worth it, especially if you hang on and wait for Lowe's to put it on sale (will hit the $250 mark on sale, so wait if you can).  There is ample storage space, plenty pf cooking area (I grill for a family of 6 on it) and it is really versatile, especially with the side fire box attached.  I was really skeptical when I was first looking at them.  As I looked and compared, the features and cost per feature began to make sense.  I really like using charcoal, but there are times where life is just too busy to wait for it or we just want to throw some dogs on the grill for lunch or in between my kids' track meet and their concert.  That makes having both gas and charcoal worth it. I went for the versatility and cost, and am very happy with it after a full season of cooking 4 times a week (sometimes more, sometimes less) on it.",

Charcoal for burgers, steaks, smoking BBQ ect and gas for quick cooking hot dogs or long cooking items like beer can chicken. We used it at least 4 times a week!

I hated the idea of having to choose between gas and charcoal. I appreciate the convenience of gas for everyday use, but wanted to be able to cook a good steak over charcoal. This grill seemed like the perfect answer.The main issue I had is controlling the heat. Both sides have poor lid fit, and many holes. As another user stated, the LP side is open enough to blow out all three burners on a windy day. On the charcoal side, with all dampers closed, it is impossible to control the temperature because there are so many leaks. The fire simply rages out of control. To make matters worse, the bars that cover the burners on the propane side do not sufficiently overlap the flames, so you have to deal with constant flare ups. Couple that with inconsistent heat that led to severe hot spots, and I was left with burnt food and a lot of frustration.There are other negatives, and some positives, that have been mentioned in other reviews. But if I can't get it to cook right without extensive mods, none of that matters.Sounds good on paper, but not worth the hassle. I use the grill often and want to enjoy it. I got rid of the Duo, and am coughing up the dough for a Weber that will perform properly and last me 10+ years.",

I love the fact that if you want to cook up somthing quick you have the gas side but if you have the time you also have the charcoal side for cooking. We also purchased the side fire box for it. Now I have a 3 in 1 grill/smoker all in one. I would buy this grill again in a heartbeat. Honestly I think the smoker is the best part. Easy to hold temp a very large cooking surface and virtually no mess. Great grill for the price. The only down fall I have found with this grill is that the gas side cooks way to hot for the size. The MFG tells you not to get the grill over 500 deg so you dont damage the paint but with only 2 burners going on low the grill stays at 400. I guess I will have to adjust my cooking style.

Everything turned out perfect!!! Best grill i have ever owned and it looks cool too. propane side gets VERY hot with all three burners on, even at low setting. keep an eye on that as the instruction manual says to not cook at temps above 450 because it can damage interior. i recomend using only two burners if lid is to remain closed. first time i smoked the pork my neighbor opened his window and stated \"thats not fair!\" he is right, its not so got pick one up today....",

I did give a new coat of paint after 4 years. The gas side still going strong. However need to get a new one for this 4th Of July celebration. would highly recommend this grill to anyone who loves to BBQ with charcoal and have the convenience of gas. Just a reminder to all who have a problem with rust. Do not wash the inside of the grill with water. Scrape and sweep out, it will last you much longer.",

My grills are kept under a carport so rust is not a big factor. I can see many many years of awesome grilling on this DUO 5050.The only thing i would change is the drip pan and propane tank are to close together.

My only complaint is that the hole for propane tank is a little small and binds up when you go to replace the tank. In the dry climate of Utah, this should last a good, long time.

            "text": "In noticing the ongoing kudos - and complaints - of this product, I am glad that I read the reviews THOROUGHLY and then followed the suggestions.First: The price and grilling features of my dual propane/charcoal griller with option for an add-on smoker - these considerations all have made this the best BBQ setup I have ever owned. Past grilles - Weber dome charcoal setup, Hibachi type grill, deluxe stainless multi grill setup. None were as versatile or effective in producing the great barbecue fare as this inexpensive, efficient product. I grill almost every week, year round; even on most rainy days (under a cover).Secondly - complaints about its durability and rusting seem to be from improper use, at least for the most part.There is a series of preventive measures that must be followed. After all, this inexpensive grille is just metal, not metal covered with ceramic. But that makes it much more efficient! Here are the precautions:a) Season the grille thoroughly, inside and out, with a relatively thin coating of vegetable oil. Don't forget to swab the inside of the stacks. The process takes only a few minutes of your time. Run it at half power / half heat for 15 minutes upon first applicaition. Let it cool, do it again.b) NEVER cook with it domed at more than 450 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 5 minutes at a time. Just regulate the heat, or lift the lid after 5 minutes to lower the temperature. It seems like this is where most barbecuers end up with a rusted product. The unit has a temperature gauge on each dome.c) Keep it dry, or wipe it down if it stays out in the rain. Obvious, eh?d) Buy a cover for around $40-55, the one that is custom made for the griller. It even has a velcro gizmo that allows it to pop out and expand for your add-on smoker, should you decide to get one. Use the cover between grillings, waiting (of course) for the unit to cool down completely.e) Season it every two years. I just got through re-seasoning mine. I have had it about 4 years and it still looks pretty much like new.If you follow all of the simple steps above, and you don't have it in an extreme weather area (like perhaps a salty environment by the sea), I can't see any reason why the grill should not last for many years. I live in the center of the hot San Joaquin Valley in California and, other than my cover starting to bleach out and show some tearing from heat rot, my unit is still in superb condition. Yes - I have already purchased a new cover to eventually place the existing one. Cheap insurance, given the very low price point for this unit, in the first place.Another plus - the igniter, after all of this time, still works perfectly. That seems to be the first thing to fail on other grills I have seen and/or used.",

We use our grille about 7 months out of a year; and I need a sturdy and durable grille to hold up to our daily use. We love the option of gas or charcoal grilling. We have used both options and the food cooks perfect. My whole family raves on how well this grille works and how easy it is to use the grille. The food is always cooked just right ; done to perfection and in a short grilling time. The rack below is very handy for storage and I really like the attached spice tray and the holder under the grille for the propane tank. We also keep our grille covered; therfore we have not experienced any rust issues. Finally the cost of the grille minus the promotion offered was a deal that I could not pass up. I am very happy that I purchased this grille.

Quality is not bad, for a grill of this price. This grill is very versatile, you can use the gas grill if you are in a hurry, or the charcoal grill if you have the time. They both work great!!!!.I also bought the firebox that goes on the side of the charcoal grill, which is used for smoking ( this is much harder to install,you might need some help). This firebox truly completes this grill,and makes this a truly all in one BBQ. I did my first smoking of meats on this grill and I have big plans and recipes for the smoker.( mouth watering as I write) I can see that will need a little more care than some of the higher end grills. But if kept clean and well maintained,it should last a while. Very Happy with the Chargirller.",

Mine has some issues, the porcelain on the grates started to come off while i was cooking food. Had to throw everything away, how that possible i dont know. Mine is rusted throughout with little to moderate use. The heat shields on the gas side rusted thru and the small tabs of metal bracket that hold them are completely rusted gone. I will have to order new grates, heat shields and weld small metal brackets to hold the shields. For a company to claim such Rust control, this grill has not held up. It started right away and has gotten worse and worse regardless of me cleaning and caring for it like a newborn baby.",

I have had great performance from each of their grills. Each time, I stepped up to a little newer and better model, finally scoring the best of their grills. I even handed down 2 of the grills to my kids. I have been a tried and true Char Griller fan from the first grill. Just over 1 year old, and the bottoms of 2 of the legs have rusted to pieces! They are literally crumbling under the weight of the grill. The other surfaces of this grill have also experienced significant surface rust, but I did not worry too much about that. I live in the same place as I did with my previous grills. I have a concrete patio surface. I faithfully use a Char Griller cover at all times. I haven't done anything different than I did with my other Char Griller grills to cause the premature rust problem. I called Char Griller's customer service department, explained everything, and they were absolutely no help. They welcomed me to purchase replacement parts from them. I did not expect a new grill, but I did expect at least a discount on the replacement parts due to the premature rusting and my customer loyalty. Ironically, I purchased their best and most expensive grill before I began to have problems. This will be the last Char Griller product I will own. Please note that this is not a reflection on the folks at my local Lowes store. They have always been very helpful.",

I finally made the purchase, and afterand hour of putting it together, using thread-locker on all the bolts, we were on our way to agrilled dinner and seasoning.A couple of months later, we are still grilling, and couldn't be happier. Very easy to use, nothing has broken, or fallen off. We removed the second grate from the charcoal side, we needed the room for chickens, turkey, etc. We also added lava rock to the bottom on the propane side. It maintains heat well, and is predictable when it comes to added charcoal, and achieving the desired heat. We keep a thermometer on the grate to measure the heat there, and it is consistent from front to back, left to right.A few things to note, it is HEAVY, especially with the propane, and a couple extra bags of charcoal on the rack. the burner grate could be a little bigger, but never gave us a problem, just would be nice. Also, the top of the propane tank is close to the drip pan, and leaves little clearance to turn in on and off.there a much better built grills on the market, but for the price this is a great value, not to mention you get two for the price of one.",

With the side firebox and side stove, the versatility of this grill is boundless. There is hardly anything you can't cook , slow cook or smoke with it..I keep mine uncovered but under a patio roof , I have no rust issues at all except some surface rust on the side firebox- no big deal..When i first got grill, I sprayed the whole inside with cooking oil and started grill with lid down to season it and I keep tin cans over the chimneys so no premature rust problems.The gas side has pretty even heat distribution, better than any other grill i have ever had.I did have to replace the gas side drip covers over the 3 burners once with universal ones from Lowe's- but that is normal maintenance. I even bolted on a 2 x 12 butcher block counter the entire length of the grill that just adds the perfect final touch of prep workspace to a perfect grill....This grill should last a long time and when it does wear out, I will buy another one just like it!!!!!",

I did spend extra to get the side box, because I need the full grate area when I do multiple racks of ribs. I've also been able to smoke a whole turkey for Thanksgiving the last 2 years (which my family loves). The key to it all is like many have said, keep treating it with oil at least once a season and cleaning it regularly. (I'm in the Bay Area of California). The Char-Griller cover that I bought separately, just ripped in year 3.

Lowe's did not have it in stock so I had to wait for it to show up at my house. It did not take to long but what I got is a chargriller universal rotisserie. The tabs in the lid were not easily removed and to use the rotisserie for a regular sized chicken you must take out the center burner cover. Then the rotisserie itself is not well built.

If you purchase on make sure you register it, MAYBE you can get some parts under warranty, I could not.  What you can expect is that the igniters will go out first (2-3 months), the burners are next (based on use, mine lasted less than one winter with weekly grilling), the drip pan and grease catcher were next and finally the duo bottom shelf.NOW, I can order all of these replacement parts (I currently have them in the cart of the Char-Griller website) for $140 plus tax and shipping, rebuild the grill and get another 1.5 years out of the burners or I can spend $250 or more on a new grill.Gas grill gets ZERO Stars!HEY!

Then the burner covers on the gas side began corroding and the hook points on which they hang above the burners themselves, rusted away and I need to use sheet metal screws to support the new covers I had to buy on Amazon.  I also rplaced the grill racks but that didn't last long. Then the warming rack decayed to nothing.  Then the entire bottom of the gas side rusted out and I had to use a piece of sheet aluminum across the bottom to keep the heat in the cook area so things would cook at all. All this time, I had no problems and rather liked the charcoal side the way the coal rack adjusted up and down to adjust heat, though those grill racks also corroded.  All of this in 4 years use. I bought a new Weber gas grill and did a chop and Frankenstein job on the charcoal side to make that useable and discarded the gas portion of this Char-Griller completely.  I wouldn't recommend this, even though it seems like a good idea.",

I use the charcoal side mostly and use the side burner to light a charcoal chimney to expedite the fire.  I keep it covered and am about to go get my 3rd cover (they fade early, but help prolong the grill life).  Grills well, has good smoke.

Both sides of this work extremely well, with the charcoal contained in a separate height adjustable tray, and the gas side cooks as well as a weber.This is a large grill, and it will take about 2 hours to put together properly. I did it myself, but get a friend. And condition the grill as the instructions illustrate. This is a heavy unit and should last for a long time. The steaks, hamburger, chicken, and pork chops I cooked so far have turned out great. No hot spots on the gas side that I've found. Charcoal side cooks pretty hot, so it takes less coals (use real wood charcoal).I cook outdoors at least 3 times per week, and am extremely satisfied not only with the grill, but with the value!One note - don't go for the cover, it is made of cheap material and will not last a season. Just buy an oversize heavy duty cover and you will be good. Cheers!",

            "text": "The Hubs bought this grill, with the side-box smoker, for Christmas several years ago. It sat in the garage, in the box, for more than a year. He finished building the pergola over our patio, and we finally put the grill to use. The Hubs did most of the assembly work himself, enlisting my help to move it and with those actions that required three hands. \n\nWe love it! We've smoked chickens, and I'm fixing to smoke my first brisket this weekend. We grill everything from asparagus to pizza.\n\nUsing the side burner to light coals in a chimney means the coals are ready to go before the meat is at room temperature. We use the gas side less often than I thought we would. It can be tricky to get the gas side to stay at a certain temperature; if that's what you want, keep an eye on it until you learn exactly where to set the knobs & the vents to get the temperature you want. \n\nWe haven't had any rust issues, even though we leave the grill out year-round. We live in a very dry climate; we average 8\" of precipitation a year, and our climate is similar to a high desert -- hot in the summer, cold in the winter. I've noticed many of the complaints about rust are written by people who live in places I think of as being really humid. I bought a cover for a stand-alone swing to use to cover this in the winter. It's heavy duck cloth, so it vents better than the plastic ones, and it'll stand up to our frequent hurricane-force winds. It's too big for the grill, but it completely covers it. \n\nThere's an upper rack that appears to be designed to hold buns. I'm not crazy about the way it attaches to the lid of the grill. In order to remove it, which I have to do to smoke or roast chickens upright, I have to unscrew the bolts that attach it to the lid. If I've forgotten - which I am wont to do - it means I have to wrangle those bolts while they're hot. Given the light-duty nature of the shelf, it could have been designed to lift off the bolts instead. That would make it much easier!\n\nThis grill is huge. Be prepared to design around it. Also, if you attach the side-box smoker, you lose the easiest way to grab ahold of the grill if you want to move it. My solution? A 4' long 1\" dowel underneath the body of the charcoal grill side - NOT the side-box - near the legs. \n\nFor the price, this grill can't be beat. At some point in the future, we may \"trade up\" to a better grill. This grill has a lightweight feel to it. But given that it's worked well for the last two summers, and given our dry climate, I can easily envision this thing lasting a decade or so. And, as others have noted, some steel wool and a can of grill paint will do wonders.",

This is nothing but a rust bucket! We even purchased TWO of the covers, which are not cheap, price wise, but beware of 'weather resistant' covers, as rain will still seep through! For nearly $40, it SHOULD NOT! This is not really a cheaply priced grill either. It lasted, barely, for two whole years. Initially we loved it, but just were naive about the quality then. We're NOT happy. This is the worst grill we've ever owned. Unless you're willing to pull it into your garage every time you use it, in an effort to keep moisture & humidity away from it, it WILL RUST! The side that rusted away, and I'm talking about the body, as well as the screws/nuts etc. was the propane side. I went to try to replace the burner tubes, tent covers, and grill plates, and they were rusted through the body of the grill, which I didn't realize until I began working on it. So I'd wasted more money buying the replacement parts. AND it will probably rust anyway, you just MIGHT get one more year out of it. We'll never buy another one.

            "text": "I've had this grill for 2 years now, out in the open, and it's held up well. Granted it's Los Angeles, but we still get our rainy season. The cast iron barrels are pretty thick... much thicker than similarly styled grills sold at the \"other guys\". In general the grill is very sturdy. The porcelain coated grills are good, but they can scratch (as I would imagine any porcelain grill does) and rust can form in the scratches. If you keep your grill clean though it's not a big problem. The thermometers are accurate. The debris catch tray under the gas side is a little hard to clean (not the grease tray...that slides out, but the larger tray that funnels the grease and debris to the trap) because it's not really accessible. I do most of my cooking on the charcoal side, but love the gas option for when we need to get something done quick, or when charcoal wouldn't really matter (e.g. hot dogs). The side burner comes in handy for sauteed onions and the like. We also deep-fry on it so that the house doesn't stink!I added the side firebox and love smoking, although I don't do it that often because of the time commitment. Great little unit! It does make the whole thing harder to move though because it restricts your ability to lift that side of the grill (you don't wanna put much force on the side-box itself, so end up trying to reach around it... really you need 2 people if you don't want to hurt your back).All-in-all I thought this grill was a steal at $299... at the current price it's a no-brainer. If I had use for another I'd buy one for sure.",

            "text": "First don't buy a fillet for your first use...you WILL burn it. This grill is hot and there is no way around it (the gas side that is). This is a brilliant idea in general, however if they would use a little higher grade in the overall construction of the grill boxes and especially the actual grill grates on the gas side, it would last even longer. I have owned this for 1 full year/grilling season and I need to purchase new grill grates for the gas side as the gas side gets so hot it has burnt off the ceramic coating on the center of the gas grates. If you do buy this grill be sure to always sear on the same side of the grill and then turn the middle off and outside burners on low (cooking your meat indirectly in the center), this allows you to keep the heat around 350-400, otherwise the box stays above 500 and flare ups will ruin your experience. Also, think of a way to change the \"bolts\" on the upper rack so the upper racks come off easy...there is absolutely no way to do a beer butt chicken as the overall height of the chicken on end is too high to close the grill lids on either side without hitting the upper grills in each lid...quick modification or removal all together will solve this.For the money and for someone who knows grilling, go for it...you can make this work. For those that don't know how to grill, start cool and work up to a more refined heat! Definitely worth the money for the convenience. (if this gets to Char Grill Co...PLEASE DON'T GLUE THE AD SHEETS ON THE FRONT OF THE BARRELs, THIS IS TACKEY AND DOESN'T JUST \"WIPE OFF AFTER FIRST USE WHILE HOT\"...)",

            "text": "When I started thinking about adding a charcoal grill to the back patio, I immediately pictured a separate grill sitting beside the current gas grill with a separate cover or having to wheel it in and out of the garage each time for cooking. As I was shopping for charcoal grills, I ran into the dual grill concept. There are only a few of these in the market, so choices are limited. For the price, this grill provides the convenience of one grill, one cover and the ability to put your charcoal chimney on the side burner for lighting. This feature alone is worth the price of admission as charcoal prep has never been quicker or easier. Don't expect the quality of a more expensive stainless steel unit, but it does the job just as well with the convenience of two grills in one. I have had the grill for two months and have used the charcoal side 5 times and the gas side twice. Buy some spray vegetable oil to fend off rust.",

If you don't know what this means it basically means that a charcoal chimney fits perfectly in it. Most grills it'll sit on top like nothing but with this one it meant for it and it looks great. It doesn't look to bad and I haven't had much returns on them. Its rugged and pure metal. To me that is amazing it doesn't get much better then that on a grill. I mean for 299$ and on sale it can come down close to 200$ no one can beat this. For both worlds and so much cooking space. I mean its no Webber or Broil-King. Yet it shouldn't be. Many companies make the whole charcoal and gas grills but truthfully this one I think is best. If you plan on grilling a lot like me|(year round multiple times a week minimum).

I slow charcoal ribs on the weekends and during the week I can fire up the gas for a fast steak after work.The only problem is the bracket on the tank side is too low to hook up the LP tank, and the valve hoses are to short to go around the front.

You must follow the owners manual and spray the entire inside with vegetable oil, which will help the grill from rusting, as it's made of steel. First time using the smoker made the best ribs I've ever made. One of the porcelain grates had a chip in it and 2 dents in one of the hoods, one email to Char-Griller and new ones were on their way. Very happy with both the the grill and the service from the manufacturer. Having the option of gas or charcoal depending on time is great. Plenty of room for everything. Side burner for that pan of whatever is very handy. Works great with a charcoal chimney for starting the charcoal, 2 minutes and good to go.

That might be because I lined them with heavy duty aluminum foil.Here's the kicker. Go price the replacement parts for this grill. The cooking grates cost $40+ EACH, the flame shields cost $26+ EACH and the top cooking racks aren't cheap either.Knowing what I know now about this grill, I would just buy separate grills of lesser cost and spare myself the heartache of having to chunk a $300 grill after only a little over a years use.BTW, the little side smoker, not worth it either (IMO).",

Within 2 years the inside was rusting so bad that the drip shields above the flames rusted to the point that I had to make my own. Then the igniter goes. Then every other time I do light it with a match the grill seems like it's getting 5% of all the propane. Tank is full. Try cooking dinner on 100 degrees. Not fun. Charcoal part is fine because it's charcoal. I was dumb and got the same model 2 years ago. Figured I did something wrong. Sprayed high heat protective spray in every corner I could. Still rusts, still gives out little heat with a full tank of propane, still having my drip shield rusted. Just waiting for the igniter to go so I can go buy a good grill",

Once I started to assemble it, it was obvious that it had been dropped from a good height. The bottom tray, both grill bodies and the smokestacks were all bent. One of the plastic feet that fit on the legs was broken. Fortunately, since I did not have time to return it to the store and still grill as planned, I was able to beat these items back into their original shape using a wooden block, a rubber mallet, and pliers wrapped in a rag to keep from scarring the finish. I will use some super glue on the leg foot.\nWhether it works as advertised or not remains to be see.",

Sadly so far those bad reviews have been right.First thing I notice upon unpacking the parts is that almost everything is covered in some type of oil or grease. There could be a purpose to it but I doubt it as it is uneven and random. I know it didn't happen in transit to the store because the outside of the box is fine while everything inside has it. Whatever the reason it was an annoying mess during and after assembly.As other reviewers have mentioned the the quality just ins't there. The welds are pretty shotty and while I've only had the grill a short time I don't have high hopes of it lasting past the year. Some of the fastening hardware was also pretty low quality. I'm no bear of a man but I twisted the head off one the screws just hand tightening it. Sadly I left the grill lids upside down in the box while I was assembling it. When it came time to attach the lids I pulled them out to find a giant scratch down the top of the lid. At this point the thing was practically assembled so I just kept going. And then the rust. One of the handles had bit of the coating missing and it had already started rusting. Then there were the little things..like obvious misspellings and being shorted the right amount of washers.. that on their wouldn't have been a big deal but combined with everything else it just toped the whole experience off.I love using it but honestly in terms of quality it is a piece of junk. Its such a disappointment. If it weren't a gift I probably would have taken it back. Bottom line is I would never recommend it to anyone.",

That also shows the problem, the durability of the grill is OK, but definately not a long term investment like something made of stainless steel. It will (no matter how often you season the grill and cover it) RUST. The last one that I had lasted four years, but I finally had to get rid of it at the beginning of this season as I was heading into a kitchen renovation and my family of four was going to be relying on my \"outdoor\" kitchen.So, the grill won't last forever, but boy is it a nice one while it lasts! The side burner is perfect for a charcoal chimney so you can even get the charcoal side up and running at about 400°F within about 10-15 minutes. The gas side is nice for two things I like to make a lot: fish (easier because lower heat control is easy) and home fries (can get the gas side to nearly 600°F and really get a disposable pan of oil pretty darn hot!The grill surface on the charcoal side is huge! I have had a two level fire built with the cool side having an entire pork shoulder (Boston Butt) and on the hot side I had veggies. Warming rack had buns toasting on the cooler side and corn on the cob warming up. In the event that I have the whole family over, I use the gas side as a warming oven to keep things ready until we serve.I use this grill all year for the past 9 years. As I said, I am on my third one so I would suggest getting the extended warranty from Lowes (3-4 years). That way, your next $300 grill will only cost you $60....",

The instructions were straight forward.-------Pros-----Gas and charcoal. I like the side burner for my chimney starter.The charcoal side is also adjustable so you can control heat very well. Its great to seat steaks on the charcoal. The gas grill heats up surprisingly fast. The electric starter is incredible. You push the button and hold it until the grill lights. No more \"turn click spark. then again turn click spark\". Its continually sparking until you let go much like a kitchen stove top. The charcoal side holds A LOT of charcoal. Easily 2 chimneys full and probably a little more. They also include a long wire match holder if you prefer matches.Two pretty large cooking surfaces. Everything is easy to replace if needed.-------CONS - - - -While these are minor. I thought I should still note them.The lids are a little flimsy. (or should I say the hinges are)It leaks smoke out of the cracks where the lid meets the bottom.electric starter requires a battery which needs replacing (no big deal). You need a custom cover in order for it to fit well. No electric starter on the side burner. (It still has one of the 1 click electric starter)It could use some more table top space. The only space is if your not using the side burner.The grill needs to be seasoned before you use it ( I want to grill now!)Overall I would say I love the grill. I would buy it again if I had the choice. Gas on the weekdays charcoal (FLAVOR FLAVOR FLAVOR) on the weekends or both if your entertaining a large crowd.Also, I would highly recommend hardwood charcoal. The flavor is intense. If you use the chimney with the side burner it fires up great. Hardwood charcoal can sometimes be hard to start.DON'T FORGET TO SEASON YOUR GRILL with Vegi oil! (IT WILL RUST IF YOU DON'T)",

It has NOT been covered since n has been exposed to all ohio's elements year round. The grill has had some mantaince such as burner tents (The original tents lasted MAYBE 3yrs before they rusted out n desintegrated.), igniter button, n regulator. The only 'seasoning' it has had is the years of use. And very recently it received its well over due cleaning when ALL the years of 'seasoning' was burned off when the grill caught on fire! Yes, the grill is now rust n probably goin to be replaced in the next year, but will buy the same one if my husband still wants both charcoal n gas grilling options.",

            "text": "OK, I just fired up this grill for the start of the fourth grilling seasons, so now I feel I can leave an honest review.Short story: This grill is going strong after 3 full seasons.Long story: Ignore the reviews from people complaining, 'the grill rusts our after one season'.  These are people who do not take proper care of the grill.  I seasons my grill at the end of every year before winter.  Seasoning, is using high heat cooking oil, don't use peanut oil (you could kill someone), to rub down most of the interior parts of the grill.  I also take out the electric start battery. Finally, remove the gas hoses and store those in the garage.  I also purchased the proper fitting grill cover.  My grill stays out all winter under the cover on my deck.  Then all spring summer and fall it is used at least an average of twice a week.  The electric start fires up all three burners no problem.  The flames are even across all three burner tubes.  I have zero rust on the outside and there is usually a little surface rust at the end of a long grilling season but rubbing with oil removes that surface layer easy.  Again, I have three full long grilling seasons and the thing works like new.Best part of this grill, I get the best of both worlds! A charcoal grill for weekends when I have the time to smoke larger cuts of meat and the week night steaks, burgers and shrimp cook quick and easy on the gas side.  All this for less money than the average gas grill!!!  I got my duo for $229 on sale, Spring Black Friday deal.  The cheapest gas grill alone was $199 that I saw.  It is like getting a full charcoal grill for $29!Great deal, great product that holds up (when taken care of properly).  You cannot go wrong",

Unfortunately, it will rust out completely as other users have pointed out. We seasoned the grates, we always used a cover, and still the whole thing is rusting from the top down. The grates have been replaced every year because they rust out so badly over the winter that they almost break in half. Also, because of the large size of this grill (especially if you add the smoker attachment) only a cover from the manufacturer will fit properly. Their cover isn't very durable either, and ours began ripping right down the middle after about 6 months of use. We replaced too many grates and too many covers for this thing. The legs are also rusting off and the grill is crumbling. This grill is under a covered porch and has always had a cover on it. We are buying something else. Don't waste your money unless you plan to keep it inside and never actually cook on it.",

We took the one in the box and when we got it home it was missing alot of parts so we took it back to Lowe's and checked another box and it had parts missing too.

Bottom line though, this grill will rust and rot no matter how much time you spend trying to prevent it.I kept it covered when not in use. The high heat would peel the factory paint and then cause rust. Twice I sanded it down and repainted it with high quality, high temperature grill paint. This helped but could not fix it long term.The heat disbursing panels directly over the flame also rust and rot and will need to be replaced. The brackets that hold them rot through and are unable to hold the panels.All of these are replaceable but take your constant attention and additional dollars. However, the high heat actually burns holes in the grill body itself and this cannot be fixed.I am now searching for a new grill and will most likely pay more for one that I know will endure multiple seasons of grilling.Too bad since I liked this grills setup.",

I've grilled, BBQ'd, smoked all different sizes and cuts at all different food temps and outside temps and cook times, etc.When it was time for a new grill I had no hesitation in choosing this one even though it only lasted me a few years, but at this price, Im ok with that.My only con is that some parts will eventually start to rust and the grill grates will deteriorate.

            "text": "After reading the mixed reviews, like a fool, I decided to purchase it. What a $400 mistake (price includes grill, side smoker and cover). I was careful to read the directions in regards to seasoning in an effort to prevent premature rust and fatigue (based on the instructions and reviews). It sat in my garage for a month (unused) before I moved it to the deck and I was extremely careful to make sure it was covered every day/night when not in use. And by the way, I fired it up for a week straight just to season it. Installed the side smoke box and fired it up for the first time to cook some ribs. After I assembled the separately purchased the side smoker box, I noticed the ash drawer would not “seat” appropriately. I decided to keep it anyway as I had ribs on my mind for the next day. It was December so it was chilly outside (Western NC). I decided to enjoy a cup of scotch and a cigar in the meantime. Within the first hour, I realized the purchase was a HUGE mistake. The paint on the lid for the side smoker box was peeling right in front of my eyes. The crate for the charcoal in the smoker box deformed. I contacted the manufacturer and their response was more or less “deal with it. That is the unit. Read the fine print”. That was over 3 years ago and I still can't find the fine print. It was only a matter of months before the unit started to rust even more, regardless with the amount of seasoning and keeping it covered. And as for the charcoal usage, 4 hours of smoking/cooking easily consumes half of a large bag of Kingsford charcoal while marinating a temperature of 225-250°F (which is a pain to maintain) whereas charcoal in Weber Kettle would last forever, and is much, much easier to maintain. The moral of the story, stick to Weber for charcoal grills and any other brand but this one for gas grills.The only good thing about this grill is that it looks good, when new and the side burner (which didn't last long due to the heat from the charcoal chimney). You have been warned!",

Nothing else is really necessary just some time.Only dislike I had while assembly was the coating they used for some of the parts. The vegatable based oil to prevent from rusting are sticky and they are everywhere. However, they are safe and you need to do nothing before using the grill.Someone else mentioned the grill leaking when you open the top, when you open the top the rack sort of moves back. Some stuff can leak onto the cover then the floor. Get a grilling mat or some napkins!If you have your doubts dont. It took us a while before deciding on which grill to purchase that had charcoal and gas. I also purchase the grill cover to help us maintain and keep this grill for a long time.",

            "text": "Do you like the flavor that comes from grilling over charcoal, but don't always have the time to warm up coals and so you're thinking of getting a gas grill instead? Before you do, consider this unit instead. It really does give you the best of both worlds.Now to be fair, I have only had the grill for around a month. I cannot testify to how well it holds up over time. I followed the instructions to 'season' it with vegetable oil prior to using it, which helps prevent rust, but since this thing ain't made of stainless steel, I'm sure a little rust is in my future no matter how much I take care of it. That being said, taking good care of it should minimize those issues. Be sure to buy the cover for it.I've grilled several times on each side now, and the results are excellent! For the charcoal side, it is possible to get very consistent and hot heat that can be regulated well with the damper. Just remember, a little charcoal goes a long way. If you fill it with too much, the grill will get too hot even if you close the damper all the way. I use a charcoal chimney which helps me regulate the amount well, and also assists in getting the coals started without any lighter fluid. The results are amazing, and even from the first burgers I grilled, that \"char-grilled\" taste came through nicely!Over on the gas side, we decided to put a couple ribeye's down for the inaugural grilling. Got the grill extremely hot first (up to about 650º), and then laid down the steaks after they'd been rubbed in olive oil, salt, and pepper, and grilled with the top open for about 5 minutes on each side. I did have to deal with several flare-ups from the burners, but that's partially just the nature of gas grilling. It didn't seem to affect the steaks negatively in any way. The results for the meat were perfect! A nicely charred crust on the edge, and medium on the inside.We have also done lots of hamburgers and hot dogs, and a few other things on the grill now too, and so far, I'm absolutely loving it. Would I recommend it? Heck yes. However, just keep in mind that it is not made of stainless steel, so, protect it from the weather as best you can by keeping it covered when not in use, and be sure to follow the instructions for seasoning it before first use.",

I have found that if you properly season the grill (using vegetable oil) the grill holds up pretty well. I do prefer the cast iron grates as when they are seasoned properly, nothing sticks. Anyways, just added the smoker box recently and smoked 4 chickens simultaneously without a problem (removed the warming rack). Definately another quality product.",

The store price was $299. It was already assembled so I thought this was a pretty good deal for the money.The gas features are average. It gets good and hot to broil steaks and the gas is controllable enough to do BBQ chicken. Keep a water bottle handy though for flare-ups. The charcoal side is adequate. I used both for a large gathering for 4th of July and it did a decent job for hamburgers, hot dogs and BBQ chicken for about 60 people.I bought the cover specifically for this model and have kept it covered when not in use. I have sprayed this grill with oil, as suggested for a rust inhibitor but it still has rusted on the outside cover on the side. Right now it's only surface rust, but in 2 years, I would say this grill will be junk.I would give it a D in sturdiness. It seems to be a bit wobbly so I wouldn't buy this if you'll need to move it often. The grates are average coated grates and they too have begun to rust despite my efforts to coats then with oil after use. I will also agree with a previous poster that the gas flame does tend to get blown out with the slightest of breezes unless it's set to high heat.As a result, like the model number suggests, this is a 50/50 item. It'll go either way. The price was right for me. And if I can get 2 years out of it, I guess it'll be worth it. But if you're looking for high quality and solid durability, you'll probably be disappointed.",

The wheels make it easy to move.  I did buy the same company cover to go with it and it looks 100%.  It should last me  at least 10 years if i take care of it properely which i plan on. If your looking for a grill and dont want to spend all your money on a shiny stainless steel grill and want to look like a pit boss then get this.",

The charcoal grill is great for the weekend, and I look forward to adding the firebox soon.Be sure to follow the curing instructions (coat with vegetable oil spray and cook at 250 for 2 hours). Other reviews talked about inevitable rust, so I bought the 4 year protection plan.I bought the grill online with an in-store pick up so I could use an online coupon code.

The design and build is very sturdy and it feels heavy. The adjustable charcoal rack is awesome too, and great for getting the heat right where you need it, whether using the gas side, or the charcoal side.I'm an AVID cook, griller, and most of all I love to smoke meats in a nice pit. I'm looking forward to getting the smoker box attachment. So I can begin that journey. I've been around a lot of cheaply made grills, flemzy, thin metal, holes and gaps losing precious heat, etc..... THIS grill has NONE. I went over it with a fine tooth comb, and only found a few MINOR flaws I dont like.The minor flaws i'm referring to is 1) The grease pan faces the back. Essentially this is only a problem if you have your grill backed up to something, in which case, the lids won't open anyways. 2) The side burner, is kinda weak in design, and cant keep a low flame in windy conditions.Like I said, the above paragraph are the ONLY 2 MINOR details I personally found going over the WHOLE grill.The only thing I didn't rate as 5 stars, is the features. Just because you can only get SO many features for this price. BELIEVE ME, this grill is NOT missing anything the average cook would need. WIth a minor understanding of grilling you can make a VAST variety of things with this amazing grillBUY IT!!!!!!",

Smoking ribs is fun and addicting thing to do on this. It's nice having the side burner to use to light the charcoal using a chimney. Then after they get hot you can easily drop the hot coals into the firebox. \n\n#2 - The gas grill flares up too easily. It's extremely hard to get the gas grill to cook evenly and you have to monitor it at all times with a water gun/cup at the ready.\n\n#3 - Rust, rust rust. The flavorizer will last about one to two season before they are shot. The firebox will rust on you every year and you'll just have to brush it and spray fireproof paint each year. \n\n#4 - Durability - The igniters are shot after the third season. The grates were pretty much ruined after four seasons. The bottom of the charcoal grill was rusted completely out after four years despite rarely using it for direct cooking. Oddly enough the side firebox never rusted through despite years of smoking meats. Two of the gas control valves were frozen solid after four years.",

The second one did the same even when I stored it under a temporary car port.  Don't waste your money on them.  The cooker itself is sturdy, can handle a large cook, and holds a good temp.  I even cooked in the rain and in the winter.  The gas/coal combo is a definite plus.  The bottom tray has since rusted away, but again.  The cooking area is amazing even till this day and guess what...Aside from dumping coal dust and cleaning the grates I have NEVER cleaned the smoking area!  If I had maintained this meticulously, like some very serious \"Grill Sergeants\" in my old units..well just imagine.

Best of both worlds... or best of all 4 worlds in my husband's case with the gas side burner (we only have an electric range inside) and the add-on smoker box, he is a happy camper. Be prepared, though, it does take 2 people about 2 hours to assemble, but none of the steps were hard. We've only had it for 2 nights, so I can't speak to durability yet. However, it seems to be better constructed than our last grill so I have high hopes for it. My only complaint would be that it has to sit so far away from the wall for the large lids (with their tall chimney stacks) to be able to open properly. There is about 12-18\" of dead space behind the grill which looks a little odd, but it's probably safer that way anyway. Overall, I have one very happy husband!",

The custom cover has worked great to keep the moisture and brutal sun at bay. Also, starting to see interior wear after lots of use over the years. The side burner is a perfect size to light coals with the chimney starter. I will definitely buy another when its time to replace.

I looked towards the ground and see black fragments. At first thought, I thought it was ash from charcoal. Second thoughts, I never seen big ash flakes. I look underneath the grill, it is the paint peeling. I called Lowes shortly after to inform them about the issue. I do not want a replacement, I want my money returned. So, I will be returning today. Now I questioned why no recent reviews on the grill. The reviews are 2013 and older. Hopefully, I have no issues with Lowes to return and get refund.",

            "text": "Unfortunately it is also much less than half the quality.\n\nYou see, I'm hesitant to give it low marks because this grill is a fantastic concept. Side by side gas and charcoal grilling? Who wouldn't love that! No time or inclination during a weekday to light up charcoal and wait? Use the gas side. Feel like taking your time for a nice slow cooked pork roast or beef brisket on a weekend? The charcoal side is there. Additionally there is a side burner to cook beans or whatever other side dishes you desire. So why 2 stars?\n\nBecause it is extremely poor quality. This thing WILL rust no matter what you do. You can season it religiously. You can keep it covered. You could even bring it indoors and it wouldn't matter. It rusts. Worst of all, the replacement parts are expensive and of equally poor quality as the originals. You can easily spend as much as what it'd cost to buy a mid-range Weber in the first place but you can bet dollars to donuts the Weber will last you 10 times as long. And that's no exaggeration. My neighbor has a Weber he bought 20 years ago and guess what, it looks better than this one which I bought 6 years ago. In fact, mine is falling apart and there is no way I'll be able to fix it at any price. Compared to my neighbor's, my grill is a wobbly, sorry sight. The side burner has all but disintegrated, the grates and flame shields are following shortly, and the ash pan is totally gone, not to mention the electronic ignition stopped working 2 years ago.\n\nNot to say that I didn't have a good time with it. I cooked many delicious meats and vegetables on it, and as a smoker it does a somewhat decent job. But in hindsight, I should've steered clear. The features are just not enough to justify the purchase. If you must get this grill for the features then wait for the sale price and do what some other reviewer does and get the Lowes extended warranty, because you are going to need it. \nAs for me, better to use that money towards a high quality grill that will last. Going forward I'll stick to the name brand I knew I should've trusted.",

I have had mine for 2 years now and it is well worth the money. I paid $299 for it and so the sale price now makes it an even better deal. I keep mine under a grill cover and have had no problems with it being outside all year. It is spacious-you can cook a lot of food at one time on both the gas and the charcoal side. The gas side is easy to light and adjust the flame. And the side burner is a great added convenience-keeps the hot dog chile warm. It has nice storage too under the grill and is easy to clean up.

            "text": "We have had this grill for 3 weeks and it is wonderful. It did take 2 people to assemble it. The instructions were not exactly simple but it was still relatively easy to put together with 2 people. However, make sure you allow yourself enough time to assemble it because its time consuming. Once we got the grill together, it was easy to use. However, we did discover that there is not a lot of room to spread out if you are using the side burner. Because, at the time, we were not using the charcoal side, we used that as table top to put the things we were using on and it was sufficient. The only other complaint I have is that there is not quite enough room underneath for the tank, so turning the gas on/off is a little difficult to do. Beyond that, the grill is heavy and sturdy. The fact that it came with hooks for the utensils is awesome. We keep it in the garage until we are ready to use it (preventing the rust that every review we read warned about). We don't have to worry about the kids knocking it over or someone trying to steal it while it is cooling off. Its too heavy to just run off with. Yet, there's a handle to make it easy enough to move out of the garage. Would I buy this grill all over again? YES!",

            "text": "I purchased this grill for my husband for his 48th Birthday (May 2012). We used it regularly as weather permitted in the Northeast, CT. I have to say I've used it and it cooks more evenly than most other grills we've had. The only issue we've run into is that the regulator after two years (his 50th Birthday) Died. We had to replace the regulator for the gas as it stopped working last fall, 1.5 years of use with an average summer use of two to three times a week. The covers that are porcelain covered steel that protect the the burners completely rusted out at the same time. We had to toss them. I can see if we were using heavy marinades or BBQ sauce it might have added to the corrosive effects that lead to their short life span but we don't use them often. My husband calls it a knuckle buster experience replacing the propane tank. He's an engineer and doesn't think the person who designed this unit had the end users knuckles in mind when designing the frame supports that hinder easy access to the area to replace an empty tank with a full tank. I will commend them again on the even cooking and accurate temperature controls of this grill. They just have the send the designers back to school for end user comfort.",

I have no complaints. After reading the owner's manual, I seasoned (veg. oil) the entire grill per recommendations. Every two weeks I break the grill down for a good cleaning. (Very easy) The S-5050 is very sturdy. It's a beast. I like the storage area underneath, storing my cooking utensils and charcoal chimney.Having both gas and charcoal capability is awesome. Through the week I use propane gas, and on weekends I use charcoal. The temperature on gas side will reach 400+ on high with cover down. I use high to low heat, and yes I do get flare up occasionally. (I got flare up on all my “OTHER” past grills) The S-5050 shows plenty of grilling room on the grates.The S-5050 stands outdoors all year round in the N.Y. weather. I have no complaints about the cover. Its great taking off the cover and having the S-5050 look great. If the cover wears out I'll buy a new one.Overall, the S-5050 grilled (charcoal) the best Beer Can Chickens. The side burner works great for steaming lobsters in a big boiling pan. I will recommend this product to anyone out there. Definitely a winner!!",

Yes - it will rust if not properly cared for. These units are not stainless steel or maintenance free. I brush mine inside and out with peanut oil about three times a year, or as needed and I keep it under a cover when not in use. The only real rust I need to contend with regularly is on my fire box, as the higher sustained heat tends to burn off the paint quicker. Again, I brush it down with peanut oil as needed. Is it maintenance free? Not a chance. Would I recommend this grill to others? In a heartbeat!",

            "text": "We already had this same grill from almost 10 years ago, but it started to rust out due to it being exposed to the elements and I surprised my honey with a new one this past Labor Day. We had bought the smoker last year so it is nice just to remove it from the old grill and replace it on the new grill. We love the charcoal side and mainly use this section more than the propane, but when there's inclement weather or not much time after work it is nice to have the propane side to cook on. We add flavored wood to the smoker after soaking it in water to get more of a smoke flavor and this grill does everything we want it too, including burning my hotdogs on purpose while everyone else takes there's off too soon. The shelf is perfect for baking potatoes, warming buns and throwing corn on while cooking other meats on the lower section. The 3 removable grates make things a lot easier to keep food on when needing to add more wood or charcoal when the smoker isn't being utilized. You only have to remove one grate instead of the whole thing interrupting your cook time.  We just scoot it over to one side if we are using all of the grates and then replace and scoot the food back over. I would recommend getting this and am looking into one for my son-in-law for their new home purchase surprise gift. :)",

Love it!Gas side has problem with having too much heat. So hot the coated grates cracked and caused the grates to rust beyond useable status by second season, I replaced them with stainless steel,($60), does cook good though. Also the bun rack is completely rusted and cannot be used at all, now the rusty flake occasionally drop on our food so I will either remove and replace or just remember.

At 52 years of age this is the first time I have one I've always used charcoal for grilling before. I love how I can start on the charcoal then finish on the propane that is how I usually cook on this grill. When I'm pressed for time I'll just go with the propane. I assembled it myself so I know how to break it down for cleaning. I got this grill in April it is holding up well even with heavy usage. Rust is and won't be a problem because of the dry desert air I also bought a cover for it plus I store it in a covered patio. I most definitely recommend this grill for anyone who likes the versatility of using charcoal , propane or both like I do.

Just don't be a rookie and over-smoke your food. It takes a little practice to get to know the right amount of coals and correct opening of the air vents to get the temp right, but it's usually not too hard to get it to 225F and hold. You'll have to add more coals about every hour or 2. The only thing you need to be careful about is the heat that comes in from the offset smoke box will over-cook the food that is closest to that side. I was able to use the coal tray, which i turned upside down and placed directly under the cooking grates. This dissipated the heat more evenly so that the food nearest the smoke box doesn't cook too fast. Other than that I love this thing for brisket, ribs, turkey tri-tip, and pulled pork...",

First, there is little replacement parts available for this product. If you review Char-Griller's web page, there are very few parts for replacement. After 5 years, even on a good product, things will have normal wear/tear. The company needs to work on their spare parts replacements. Second is their packaging. With such a large and heavy product, the packaging they spend on it seems to be on the cheap side. Thin walls and little form inserts makes for the product to be damaged if you buy it to take home to put together. Also, I received a unit that was missing the charcoal top that apparently was damaged during shipment. The missing top was a Lowe's mistake upon receiving the unit, but could have been avoided by better packaging.",

Unfortunately, after the first year of owning this grill it still had a significant amount of rust on it. Fortunately though, I purchased the extra protection plan for $39. Without any hassle at all I called the protection plan number, they issued a gift card for the grill and I am going this week to buy the same grill again. Needless to say, I will also be purchasing the protection plan again. The quality of the food produced makes it worth the hassle, and even if the next grill produces the same rusting result, you can't complain about getting a new grill every year for only $39!",

We have had this grille for 3 or 4 years now and it sits covered ( factory vinyl cover that obviously helps preserve the finish all year long in the NE ) on our outside open deck.  NO rust at all, no failures, and built like a brick s--t house.  Quite heavy as an assembled unit.  I feel the quality is heavier gauge and built better than most since this steel Grille has held up better so far than any of the other stainless steel units, of which we have had four or five over the years.  They literally burned out and/or fell apart in not so long of a time.  I replaced the gas tube burners in a couple grilles and the last one three different times as the perforated lines burn out after a while.  We don't use the gas burner often although it works fine.  Also worth mentioning is the fact that the ignition system for the gas side has NEVER failed and works flawlessly still EVERY time for EVERY burner.  I had to resort to a long end lighter for most of the burners in the past grilles.  The Char Griller gas side heats within 500° to 600° in 5 to 6 minutes with only three burner tubes.  We often use the charcoal side for steaks, ribs, and burgers when time permits.  Obviously the gas side heats quicker and gets used about the same amount of time for burgers, hot dogs, and whatever else when time is more limited.  Everything is still in great condition with absolutely no issues ever.  As far as we are concerned, this is the best Grille we have ever had and will buy another if and when the time comes.  There are good stainless steel units with guarantees, but the prices are two to three times the cost of the Char Griller ( ours was on sale for a good bit less than they are now back when we bought ours off season ).  I stick with what works best for us and this unit is it- hands down.  I love our Griller.",

            "text": "I love this grill! Bought new in April 2010 and still going strong in January 2016 however starting to show its age; primarily from use and old age. It is starting to rust out, mostly on the gas side (See Below) but that is to be expected. I originally assumed it would last maybe 3 or 4 years and that was all I expected and yet I'm still using it almost 6 years in. I did rub it down with vegetable oil and fired it up prior to 1st use to season it and I attribute that to its long life. I'm guessing the reviewers whom are having rust problems after only a year or two did not perform this critical step, if you buy one of these, DO THIS STEP FIRST! I do have a cover but I seldom use it. This grill is stored outside in Sacramento CA and I have used it year round at least 1 to 3 times a week since new. It is located under a 10x10 pop up canopy. I also have two other friends with the same grill that are going strong after 5 years whom also did the same seasoning process. You need to understand that this is a metal unit painted with high heat paint and not enameled like a Weber Kettle or similar unit so some routine maintenance & upkeep is to be expected and required; if it starts to rust; sand and paint it with high heat BBQ paint. Two years ago I did have to replace the gas side heat shields. I made new ones from stainless steel about a $7 fix. At the same time I converted it to natural gas and plumbed it into my home gas line. No kit available so I drilled the jets out and purchased gas lines from Lowes. Works Great, burns hotter than propane which it great for searing and grilling steaks etc. I can now get over 700 degrees for a great sear if and when desired. I also replaced the thermometers with some better ones I purchased from Lowes, about $7 each. The electric starters and side burner died shortly after conversion that but no big deal, I light it with a long nose lighter, again they were 4+ years old. I'm planning on buying another one of these plus the smoker box attachment this spring, However I will hang on to this unit as a backup as the charcoal side is still very usable. One can never have enough grills! My only complaint is that Char Griller does not offer any kind of natural gas conversion kit or even offer just the replacement gas jets; you have to purchase the entire propane hose/regulator setup to get new jets. I highly recommend this grill to any one and have been more than satisfied.",

I brought my side firebox over from the previous grill so that I can continue with my Smoking. While I gave up about 1/4\" of the space in the charcoal side coming from the Pro to the DUO, it's been well worth it to have the flexibility of using the propane for a quicker grilling when I don't have time to wait for the Charcoal to heat up. I also love the fact that pretty much every part on the Chargrillers are replaceable from the manufacturer. My previous Pro CharGriller lasted me for 8 years, and was still going strong when I upgraded to the DUO. I replaced a few parts over the years as things rusted out, etc. If you really want these to last a long time plan on buying a new cover for the grill every year, and make sure you clean it out after using and put the cover on it to protect it from the elements.",

            "text": "I love this grill. It has everything I need and more. I purchased it at full price after waiting for months to go on sale. I don't regret it a bit, as it is worth every penny. I also bought the cover and side firebox at the same time because I figured I'd like to do it right the first time. I put separate reviews on those items and would encourage you to look those up if you're seriously interested in this set up.The eventual home for this guy is under a covered patio. That should help some with the weather concerns and rusting out as fast as some of the other reviews. I built it slightly different from the directions, as I want to use it as a built in rather than have it freestanding on the legs and wheels. If you choose this option, be warned, it is really heavy and a bit tricky to assemble, especially with the firebox installed. Basically you just don't put the legs on, and bolt everything else up but you use the crossbar supports as feet and let the firebox hang off the counter top or whatever you are using for your built in. In this configuration, the drip pans just barely clear the counter. I had assembled it completely in the garage on a workbench and then carried it with help to its final home. This way I was assured of getting everything tight and square.Features: Gas SideThe gas side is a 3-burner that seems to heat evenly. Be cautious as you can easily overheat this grill. Even with all 3 burners on low, the temperature rose quickly to over 400 degrees with no food on the grate. If you overheat it, you will void your warranty and peel the paint prematurely. To get lower temps, you only need to light 1 or 2 burners. The controls and lighter are great. Large easy to use smooth turning knobs and easy to light. Nice. the side burner is excellent with plenty of heat. On my last grill the side burner was practically useless. Not here. I can see boiling water quickly on this one. It cooks better than my last propane only, relatively expensive grill.The first meal I cooked on the gas side was BBQ chicken breasts. They came out fantastic, juicy and not burned around the edges, but still with delightful grill marks on the meat. Cleanup wasn't too bad and most of the sauce came off the grates pretty easily.Features: Charcoal SideI really like the adjustable venting to control the temperature and I was able to do so surprisingly well with the smoke box installed. It is just balancing the intake and exhaust. It would have been nice to have a removable ash pan without having to remove the cooking grates, but I'm not sure how this would have been possible. My charcoal grate was welded at the factory crooked on its pan. It bothers me a bit but doesn't affect the function at all. I think you'd have to wait for it to cool entirely before emptying the ash, as you need to remove the grates and the fingers to remove the pan and since it is all welded it isn't easy to get totally empty. The fingers to raise and lower the coals is really nice. I really like the condiment rack on the front too. Overall, very good.With the side firebox installed, I was able to cook baby-back ribs for 5 hours with little difficulty. It was easy to maintain the temperature and keep the fire going. I even used the firebox to cook some hot dogs for the family for lunch while smoking the ribs. Bonus double duty.Seasoning:I took the time to get some spray 100% olive oil and followed the instructions meticulously. I oiled it inside and out and made sure to cover all the seams and welds. Use a rag and work it into every space you can see and feel. Then it is time to season the grill which will take about 4 hours. If you skip this step, or to repeat the process occasionally you can be assured of a shorter life of this grill.I have owned several grills over the years, mostly propane gas stainless types. They have lasted years and needed little maintenance. After reading the reviews, and purchasing this one, I am convinced that this is not a grill for the amateur griller. It will need more time, care and maintenance than I ever gave my others. I fully understand that it will not last as long being cast iron, but at the price and with care I should be able to get many good seasons out of it. This grill will give professional results if you put the time and care into it.",

Forgot to mention that we grill year round here in NC and use both sides about equally with my wife using the gas side when I'm not home. There was some significant rust where the supports for the burners covers rest on. I had to add a few modifications to keep the covers in place. But overall I got my money's worth. Just keep seasoning it every year and it will last. I'll probably get another one when the price drops back down to $250. Right now it's not an emergency so I can wait to save the 50 bucks. Also, don't waste your money on a cover, it will fall apart after1 + years and really might do more harm than good keeping the moisture trapped adding to the rust problem.",

Though its not really portable, it have taken it on group camping trips half a dozen times- yes I had to retighten screws on the base when I got home. It has survived 2 moves- one across the country. I mostly grill on the charcoal side, and I light the charcoal with the side burner and chimney style holder. I have the rotisserie attachment, and while I would prefer it it was a bit higher, it works fine. Gas side is excellent for indirect heat cooking for beer can chickens, or salmon on a plank. BBQ is ready for its 3rd fabric cover, and I replaced the gas heat shields 2 years ago. I have the smoker attachment and used it only once. Nearly smoked out the neighbours. It worked well, but best if you live in the country. The adjust on the left burner broke, and now trying to decide if I should replace the manifold (Love that you can buy parts and repair the unit), or just buy a new unit and take this to my parents, where I grill occasionally. Easily the best grill I have ever owned.",

            "text": "I bought this grill 4 years ago and it has been great. I already knew how to do the BBQ basics in regards to steaks, chicken breast, pork chops etc. I figured this grill would be the perfect grill to take my BBQ cooking to the next level. I did purchase the side firebox to start smoking food and test the capabilities of this grill. Since buying this grill I have learned how to do pork shoulders, whole chicken, ribs and brisket. This grill is great for anyone wanting to do the occasional BBQ or to do more advanced cooks. It has held up very well through the years being that I live close to the Gulf of Mexico. I cook on it at least 1-2 times a week. I don't have any holes or major rust spots on the grill due to keeping it covered under a patio and also under a grill cover. I just purchased the Char Griller Kamado Ceramic Grill due to reliability and overall satisfaction I have experienced with this grill. I would recommend this grill to anyone and in fact I bought my cousin one when he bought his first house. I hope this review helps. Cheers.",

It's a great grill, but this one is simply more fun to cook on. The gas section gets extremely hot, nearly \"pegging\" the thermometer at 700 degrees. Not sure about the accuracy, but the grill is extremely hot, letting out considerable heat when opened and allowing a really loud sizzle. When you factor in the charcoal section, allowing you to use both cooking methods at once...it's a party. Andf...as we all know, NOTHING is better than natural lump charcoal seasoned with a bit of hickory chunk wood. It simply cooks great and is fun to use. The downside, this grill will last two years, maybe three, if stored in the garage over the winter. It's simply not made to stand the test of time, but at 299.00 I'll be buying another when this erodes to rust. I have not used a grill that is a much fun or cooks as well. Was not the easiest to assemble...Hope this helps with your decision.",

Cons: Bottom of gas rusted out after several years. Smoker side is difficult to control with heat. Front and back of bottom halves on both sides tend to bend when using grill brush causing grates to fall into in. When the optional side smoker box is added this unit becomes pretty long and awkward to move (but not impossible). I use this product for a variety of grilling and smoking. I have made a couple of modifications including replacing the vents on the gas side with vents designed for the charcoal side so I can control the heat better. I also bought some high temp silicone and gasket material to make the smoker more efficient. I found that if I close the vents on the gas side and take off the grate on over one of the end grates I can put aluminum foil packs of wood chips directly on the flame guard and smoke meats between 180-225°F for more than 12 hours at a time and use less than a 1/2 a tank of propane.",

            "text": "I bought this from Lowe's spring 2017 and this is the best grill I've ever had. I have tried a lot of different grills and this hands-down wins. Dual fuel - when it's a weeknight, I'm cooking steaks quickly on the gas side. Heat is excellent and even throughout - no crazy hot spot in one section.  On the weekends, I take my time and fire up the coals. The grate adjusts in multiple positions for searing or thorough cooking. There are two vents - and air draw at the pan and adjustable flue on the chimney. I can control heat temperature and also smoke with this. Smoking - it's not a full bore smoker as is (you can buy the attachment), but I've had great success using coals on the sides of the grill grate and at the lowest setting. A note - add new coals after about 1.5 hrs. Don't believe the “it rusts quickly” comments. Get some Pam and spray down inside, use the cover and if it gets wet, dry it. And by the way, this is a $300 grill and will last as long as a $1000 grill with proper care. Built sturdier than other brand name grills I've had and simple to assemble (1 person). Enjoy!",

            "text": "Concept is great. Went against bad reviews because I wanted it so badly. First year started to show signs of rust. I know how to properly season a grill and it's components. Second season in and gas won't even flow through tubes, grates and mounting points for grates rotted out beyond repair and falling apart. Gas side is completely unusable now. Even after clearing out the tubes still won't flow and it doesn't matter because the rest of it fell apart. As for the charcoal side, well I'm glad it's still there, at least I could still use it. I'm afraid to look at the bottom of it because I hear they rot out too. I don't use water to put out flames or flame ups so I'm hoping the bottom will be ok. Nuts and bolts keeping loosening up and initial set up was not the easiest. That is not a complaint just a fact. Through reading all of the bad reviews over the past days I wish I would have listened to them. Company doesn't seem to back product and they always seem to have an excuse putting the customer at fault. If you want a grill that is super fun to use but only last 1-2 years then go for it. I myself enjoyed it but feel like I wasted money on a pile of rust. Very disappointed.",

            "text": "During the summer months, I grill almost 5 times a week. Having both gas and charcoal on one grill makes this a really versatile grill. I've had mine for 3 years now and have only had to replace the grates and cover. Regular cleaning and seasoning properly are the key to longevity, as is keeping it covered (which means going out after the grill cools to cover it). I do have to say that the side burner rusts far too easily. After about 3 or so uses I find I have to grind and re-paint it with hi-temp spray paint. I only used it once for potatoes- it left a ton of carbon all over the bottom of my pot (which might be user error). The occasions where I do use it have been with my charcoal chimney. A few mods are necessary to make it seal properly, and they are easily found on YouTube. They can make this grill (with the side firebox attached) into a near-Pro smoker. So for the cost and a little effort, you'll have a great setup. Don't trust the temp gages- use your own. Grate level is the way to go. Support was really good. When I ordered new grates, one arrived cracked. Customer service shipped out a replacement no questions asked. I'd buy another, and when it's time I definitely will.",

            "text": "I had purchased the 50/50 about 10years ago, got a solid 8 years of useage. Did a few modifications to it, heavy duty wheels and axle (for ease of movement) on back, HD casters up front, smoke / air hose (on the charcoal side), fabricated baffles for indirect cooking. Needless to say, I did use the charcoal side more than the gas side. Gas is good for quick flames and smaller meal preparations. Side burner was great for using for my chimney, even being on the far end of the grill so lighting was always tricky and as a sauce warmer/beans and other items. I did have to put the grill down out in the back forty due to years of usage, despite multiple covers and part replacements, rust caught up with her and the front legs finally gave out. I recently got one of the Kettle Grill/Smoker from Char-Griller and am looking forward to many years of grilling happiness just as I had enjoyed with my Duo. I recommend Char-Grillers as I have been happy with most of my purchases from them, easy to mod things if needed, but the Main Thing to assure long use, CLEAN out your grill after each use (after coals have cooled sufficiently of course) but get those used ashes out....

            "text": "I bought this grill from Lowe's 3 years ago.  I bought a cover with it as well.  I have had no trouble with it since I bought it.  I cook outside a lot.  I even cook in the winter.  I wore out the first set of burner plates but I expect 3 years is pretty good for those.  My wife had a \"small\" fire on the gas side one night while I was away and it cooked the thermostat.   Ordered a new one and popped it in in seconds, not minutes.  I love the durability of this grill.  I cook on one side or the other and I cook one side at a time, depends on my mood and what I want to cook.  I bought the burner box for the end of the charcoal side too. Drop in some wood or wood and charcoal both (in the firebox) and I make the neighbors crazy on a Saturday or Sunday.  The smoke from ribs or pork loin or even a whole chicken usually brings them out and has them nosing around.  Only down side I have found is if you are truly into long hours of smoking, it's a bit hard to regulate the temperature but this is a grill first off not a true smoker.  I enjoy this grill very much and I think you will too.  You don't have to spend a thousand dollars or more to make you food taste like a million bucks!  Bon Apetit!",

I probably should have read them before we bought the grill, but we had seen this and all the supposed benefits got us excited. I haven't had it long enough to experience the rust, so I'm going to try to protect against that but what I'm more disappointed in is the performance. The first night I had it, it cooked great. The weather was nice and I fired up both sides of the grill to clean the manufacturing junk off of everything. I was thoroughly impressed with how fast it heated up.\nWell, I tried again tonight - we had a pretty good cold snap for North Carolina and I tried to fire up the gas side (second night I've ever used it) and I couldn't get the temperature up past 300 degrees. I finally took an old t-shirt and wrapped it around the two stacks to stop the heat from escaping and I was able to get it up to 330 degrees and it finally cooked the chicken. That is really lame. Every other grill that I've ever had was able to cook through the winter with no issues (and that was in northern Washington and New England) but this is weak at best. I like the fact that I can do both, but I think that given another chance, I'd buy a gas grill that worked and I'd buy a ceramic grill for the charcoal.",

            "text": "I've had my duo 5050 for over a year. I also have the side fire box with it. We grill a LOT- normally 5 or more times per week. It's incredibly versatile. I can do stuff on the gas side when time is crunched, grill over charcoal when there is more time (my preferred method), and smoke a ham or ribs on a weekend. Or all both gas & charcoal if we are having a lot of company. The side firebox can double as additional charcoal space if needed. A few things to be wary/mindful of: Do the maintenance. Clean it regularly. As you would expect from anything else, improper maintenance will lead to problems such as rust, etc. The charcoal side and firebox do NOT hold smoke well. It's actually pretty poor as far as that goes. A little furnace-grade wrapping is needed if you really want to use this as a smoker on a serious basis. Not a fan of the charcoal basket adjustment- changing heights during a cook is not recommended, even with gloves on (I burnt my self pretty good while wearing grilling gloves). The side burner does fit a charcoal chimney, but rusts easily due to the finish coming off. Be sure to grind it down and re-coat with hi-temp spray paint on a regular basis. If you are prepared to do the work, this is a great grill. But it requires a good bit of TLC.",

The bottom of the charcoal side was badly warped and the lid would not close properly- meaning no seal whatsoever. I called Lowes and they replaced the charcoal side for me. However, when I got it home and assembled, I noticed that the one of brackets that holds the charcoal tray lifts was missing (it had 3 of 4), there was a worn spot on the top that went right to the bare metal and the bottom was again slightly warped- the grates didn't rest properly on it. I had to disassemble the unit (I don't own a truck, so getting it in my vehicle means disassembling...) and had Lowes (again) replace it. This time the entire grill was exchanged. \n\nDo NOT simply rush into assembly (like I did) in the excitement of getting into building it. That said: a company manufacturing a product ought to have better standards and inspection before its product leaves the plant. Returns like that are costly.\n\nYes, that's why I only gave it 3 stars. It took 3 trips top get it right when it should have taken one. I will update in the future once I've seen it perform over time.\n\nPurchase the EPP, but be aware that if you exchange the grill, you have to purchase the EPP again for the new grill to be covered. It only covers ONE TIME EXCHANGE.",

            "text": "This grill has the best of both worlds, the convenience of gas and the great taste of charcoal. The assembly takes a bit over the hour suggested on the box, but the instructions are quite clear and easy to follow. The gas grill works well and gets very hot very quickly so often you only need one burner, especially if you work with the lid closed. The charcoal side is great because you can lower and raise the charcoal easily, but I have found that controlling the temperature is a bit of a challenge. I did discover that it takes less charcoal than my other grills though which is a plus. If you spread the hot coals thinly over the charcoal tray and close the air intake and the smoke stack, it will stay at a cozy 300-325 degrees for long term smoking.A great feature that I use a bunch is the side burner. I haven't used it to cook, but it was designed so you can put a charcoal starting can over it and use the gas to light the charcoal. AWESOME!Really the only issue I have with it is the temperature control on the charcoal side. (I have become accustomed to my Weber Kettle from the mid 1970's) Once I get past that learning curve, I don't envision any issues with the grill. If there is an issue that cannot be remedied by learning the unit, it is the length of the entire unit. It is quite long (about 6 feet), but that should be expected with a double grill with an extra burner on the side.",

            "text": "I bought this at Lowe's about 7 years or so ago! In that 7 years I have had to replace all 6 grills, half the hardware and now I need to replace the charcoal holder, REALLY? Details; the hardware, nuts to be exact, started falling off after 18 months, maybe this was the stores fault that put it together IDK, but they didn't supply the hardware, the manufacture did. What I'm saying they should have supplied heat locknuts to stay on instead of falling off inside the burner area. Next; the grills coating started peeling off after about 3.5 years and the store didn't have them in stock but could order them for me. Sounded ok until the price of them were $50 A PIECE. 6 of those is $300 and I could just buy another grill and have money left over!! Luckily Lowe's found a substitute for half that after a couple of months! For a while one of the charcoal hold trays bar where the side hook catches charcoal holder broke and I've been living with this for a while, a year I'll guess. But now there are holes in it where the heat has eat away the metal and that's just wrong. I have stored this on my porch the entire time with a cover on it (which by the way I'm on my 2nd one now because it sucks too) with no rain getting on it, and it needs replace. A grill should last 10 years or longer, at least, I use this 15 to 20 times a year and I'm tried of replacing things on it. One other thing; this grill will NOT stop the charcoal from burning up completely after you close the lid, charcoal I should be able to reuse, saves money from buying more and starts the next fire faster, but not on this one! I have an empty nest now but before, I use to cook almost every weekend during the summer for the family!P.S. Something about me;I did 20 years in the Navy and I came out 60% disabled.What I essentially did was defended the Judicial Branch, the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branches of our government.I feel I have earned every right this country has given its citizens.",

            "text": "This grill gets very hot on the propane side (almost 700 degrees on mine) and should not be left unattended once firing it up for a good preheat. With that said, for $300 you get modern day convenience with old school taste. Just remember to clean it out periodically, not every time so you keep the \"flavor\". There's so much room if you want to use both sides of the grill that I have hosted parties and fed well over 30 people easily in less that two hours of grilling. The design for the airflow is also excellent as the vents are designed to give you the option of adding a smoker box or simply setting your meat off to the side of the large grates to actually barbeque, not just grill. The simple Weber types are only for grilling and not truly a BBQ pit since your meat is always over the heat source.You also need to purchase the custom cover, which is reasonable and well made, if your grill is not under a covered area. It will rust quickly if left exposed to the elements. I have been through 3 of these BBQ's in the last 7 years. First one made it four years, second two #the metal felt like it was thinner than the last# and the last was my own fault since I was procrastinating keeping the gas side grease and dripping free. Left it while pre-heating and came back outside 5 minutes later to a propane fueled fireball that would not burn out. The extended warranty that Lowe's sells for this BBQ is outstanding. I burned mine down after 1 year of use and had a new BBQ in my back yard the next day. I cook outside year round and at least twice a week sometimes for extended periods, this grill is worth every penny! For the use I get out of this BBQ if I have to replace it every 3 years, it's still a bargain.",

            "text": "I have had my 5050 with side fire box for 9 years now and it has been a great grill. I average using it 1-2 times per week and have smoked briskets, baby backs, turkeys, salmon, shrimp, boston butts, whole pork shoulders, chicken wings, and cooked the usual steaks, burgers, etc. I have to say up front that the negative reviews about rust will happen if you don't take the time to season the grill according to directions and/or leave it out in the open weather. I have taken reasonable care of mine by keeping it seasoned with vegetable oil (on the outside usually twice a year and the cooking grates every cook) and when it was out in the weather I kept it covered (it's under an open sided shed now).It's just now rusting thru the left side of the bottom where I regularly bank the lit charcoal when cooking over direct heat. I only use the gas side now when the wife says, \"I want porkchops in 20 minutes!\" but when I used it more the grease shields over the burners rusted away after 5 years, not too bad and I rarely cleaned those. The fire box has held up well. I can say that if you over heat the fire box it will blister the paint but that's the user's fault and would happen in anything except cast iron. I use a charcoal chimney for starting all my fires and the \"minion\" method of building fire for long smokes and can get about 6 hours at 260F with just adding chunks of wood along the way to keep the smoke rolling. This probably has contributed to the longevity of the grill. Bottom line - If you are the person who cooks your food then walks away from the grill leaving it out in the weather year round get a city slicker stainless grill. If you are a person who is serious about smoking and charcoal cooking with the occasional need for a \"quickie\" with gas and take reasonable care of your equipment get the 5050 and the side fire box. You'll be glad you did. P.S.-The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is one of the ash pan hangers broke a spoke 3 years after I bought it.",

            "text": "While I've had two grill covers that have succumbed to the elements over five years of this grill sitting outside multiple houses, my CharGriller Duo is still sturdy and going strong. I tell people anytime the topic of grilling comes up that having the gas/charcoal option is simply amazing. During the busy week, when I get home late from work, or even during a rainstorm, the gas is quick, easy, and clean way to get cooking fast and clean. Perfect control for searing tuna, too. But for weekend cookouts, when I want to smoke something or have a more richly-flavored feast and I've got the time, the charcoal delivers a truly wonderful cooking experience. I've also used both grilling sides at the same time for larger events. Great options to adjust height and ventilation in/out on the charcoal side. Bonus that the instruction manual came with a solid introductory guide to grilling, that helped me grow more advanced in my grilling techniques. While heavy, wheeling the grill to the other side of the deck to be more downwind of guests is an easy feat, and I've used the wheels more than I would have thought. I'll note, however, that I can't really attest to the efficacy of the side burner, as I really only use it for food prep. For maintenance, besides keeping my cover on, I try and oil the grill every year or year and a half, and will often do one side while I'm waiting on food from the other side. Grease and ash traps work really well, and are quick to empty.  While my wife thought the Duo was ugly (\"big, black barrels in our backyard\"), especially compared to some fancy stainless things, the flexibility and practicality of this grill quickly won her over. Neither of us would imagine switching to anything else now, and giving up the flexibility and durability that the Duo offered. 5.5 years later, I would buy this grill again in a heartbeat. (Side note: I think it's worth investing the ~$10 for a gas gauge. I only have one tank at a time, and once placed underneath the grill, it can be awkward to try and pick up the can to see how much is left by weight.)",

            "text": "I bought this grill last week and I have only used it once, but I am impressed with this grill. I went ahead and bought the side firebox that doubles as a portable grill. I smoked a Boston butt the first day I had it and it came out perfect! Ok. I had a little help from a meat thermometer, but keeping the coals going and the smoke flowing was a breeze with this grill.I read a lot of the previous reviews on this grill, including the negative reviews, and I can tell you this grill is everything it is intended. The only con I have overall is one fairly minor thing, and I admit I may have missed it in the manual, when you're assembling this grill make sure the gas line going to the side burner is threaded through the side of the support bars. After putting mine together 100% (it took quite a while# I seasoned it and got it ready to burn for a couple of hours as the instructions state. I went to hook up my LP tank, and I had the gas line going around the front of the support bar. I'm afraid over time this is going to ruin the line. So now, before I use the gas side of the grill, I'll have to take the side burner off, thread it through and then reattach it. It would have been much easier to thread the control panel through the side while I was putting it together. If you take nothing else away from this review, take that advice.Anyway, back to the good. I love to grill and I love that this grill gives you all the options. On my days off I like to slow cook ribs and chicken in the smoker. On days I work, I like to cook steaks on the gas side #as I'll be doing tonight my wife has informed me :-) ). If you're serious about outdoor cooking you can't go wrong with this grill; especially for this price. If you have the means, take advantage of the free assembly. By \"means\" I mean if you have access to a truck. Those guys have probably put 100's of these together and can probably get it done in less than 5 hours. I actually enjoyed putting mine together, but I know not everyone shares my amusement.One last pro, and I'll quit boring you. Invest in a chimney charcoal starter. The side burner is designed in such a way the chimney starter fits right over the burner and does a fantastic job starting charcoal.",

            "text": "Ok here goes, I purchased this grill and fire box about 3 years ago and have used it just about 2 or 3 time a week year round. I thought I knew grilling before but after I got this one, I realized I was wrong. First let me start with the side burner. I use this feature mostly for starting my charcoal in a chimney charcoal starter and it works great. I have also used it to cook bacon, sausage, eggs, fried chicken and fish. A real asset if one doesn't want to smell up the house with fried foods.Next is the gas grill. I use this side mostly during the week when I want to grill but don't have time for charcoal. One can control the heat very well and with 3 burners the heat can be regulated very well. This side is also very good for searing steaks before slowing cooking them to perfection. I also use this side when I'm cooking vegetables and the top rack is prefect for grilling corn on the cob. The top rack is also good for toasting buns for hamburgers and hot dogs.Now for my favorite part, the charcoal side and fire box a must. Now this grill has 3 grates on each side so putting charcoal in and lighting or charcoal that is already going very easy. The grill cooks very evenly and with the large cooking area one can cook a lot of food. I have had up to 4 full racks of ribs going at one time. The one thing that I had to do on the charcoal side was remove the top rack to cook larger pieces like Boston Butts. The temperature can be regulated very well using the dampers on the top and on the side, I can hold the temperature at 225 to 250 very easily. If I decide to cook directly over the coals that works good too. the coal can be raised and lower by the handles on each side. So if one wants to cook over the coals or slow cook, it can be done easily.Now for a few down sides, this grill is not bullet proof. It will wear out as I found out this year, 2014 but I did use it a WHOLE lot. It doesn't have a lot of space to set plates and cooking utensils on. The grease shield over the gas burners will burn out with a lot of use. And if this grill is to be moved around very much, it gets heavy. With it only having wheels at one end one has to lift the other end. I also bought the fitted grill cover and it was a complete waste. Go ahead and get the generic cover, you'll be glad you did.So if someone ask me if I would buy this grill again? You bet I will.And one last note on this grill that I have found out is, It works very well when I have a cold beer when I'm grillin'",

It, by far, is the best BBQ i've ever owned! I use the charcoal side the most, so that side has zero rust. The gas side has a small amount of rust but it goes away when you use it and cook on that side. You should definetely get it. If and when mine starts to get too old..I will be re-buying this grill again...but it doesn't look like it's going to happen for awhile.",

I'm meticulous about reading manuals and followed the recommended oiling intervals, keeping it covered with the custom black cover (which is not impermeable btw, and will last about a year before itself disintegrates into an unsightly grayish material), etc, but no matter what I did, rust eventually did develop and by now (about 6 years later) it's falling apart. The electronic igniter also failed after about 3 years, as well as one of the three gas knobs. Some may disagree, and that's fine, but I'm just saying that was MY experience.",

The stick on variety that detects temp differences is also a crude attempt to gauge the remaining liquified gas. Another way is to disconnect the hose from the tank, step on your bathroom scale with the tank of unknown quantity and see how the wt differs when it was just filled. Oh, you forgot to weigh it after you filled it? Darn! If you turned in your partially filled tank because your last inaccurate gauge said it was empty then you probably didn't get a full fill. It's just not accurate trying to guess. The best method is to run the grill until the tank empties and it flames out then switch to your spare full tank then re-light before the grill cools off. A pain but no waste. Most places refilling charge by the weight at the end of the refill. If it was 1/4 full you wind up paying for the old as well as the new gas. Some charge the difference of the pre- and post refill. If you exchange tanks based on one of those inaccurate online or stick on gauges you will be likely be more Blue than the company since you just gave them a partially filled tank and exchanged it for the full over-priced exchange tank. Try the big \"C\" next time for 1/2 the cost of the refill.",
