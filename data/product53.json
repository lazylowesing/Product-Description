I am going to try filling or taping up the holes and see what happens. Other than that it is an aggressive cut and it may be a little too coarse for ceramic and porcelain tile and may produce small chip-outs. I suspect the holes in the blade are there to keep it cooler when dry cutting so I would leave them open cutting pavers or any dry material.",
