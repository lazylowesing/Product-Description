            "text": "My first impression of the fan's packaging is that it was an incredibly small box. Upon opening the box and taking out the contents I could see that it was constructed well and the pieces were in good condition with no scratches to the paint or blades. Every item was packed really nicely.\nDuring installation, I noticed that the manuals instructions were clear and concise and easy to understand and the pictures were also easily identifiable to assemble the parts. If you have never hung a fan before and feel capable of doing so, the manual would be an easy guide to complete your task. There is a troubleshooting section with certain problems you may be having and how to correct them. There is also a parts list in case you need to order any parts. The back side of the manual also has the instructions in Spanish. There is an 800 number to call in case you are missing parts or having any problems. Even though the fan light socket says 6.5 watt max for LED, the manual says regular 60-watt max bulb, you can also use a CFL bulb, however, a halogen is not recommended. \n\nI am using mine with the white side of the blades showing downward. However, if you are wanting to use the wooden side please note that the edging of the blades are white. You may not notice it from below but something to keep in mind if that type of thing bothers you.\nCompared to some other fans I have installed or uninstalled this fan motor is incredibly light and easy to hang. It is extremely easy to lift up the ladder and to the ceiling bracket. This is a 1 person job. I am a female and installed mine by myself with no issues in about 10-15 minutes. The fan comes with everything needed for assembly except for electrical tape and tools. Even though it called for a number of different tools I only needed a phillips head screwdriver to get the entire job done. The ceiling bracket has a notch to hang the fan from while working on the wiring. This way it frees up both of your hands so you do not have to hold the fan with 1 hand prior to mounting. The parts bag comes with 1 extra washer, 1 screw for hardware on the blade, and 1 screw for the blade to fan assembly. So if you should drop one and lose it you will have 1 backup.\n\nThe box includes an LED lightbulb that is 6.5 watts. The fan comes with a blade balancing kit if you are having a problem with a slight wobble. The fan does not have any indicators letting you know which side to hang either chain pull from. However, the manual will show you an illustration indicating which side takes which pull for the light and the speed control of the fan. There are 3 speeds. The fan definitely hugs the ceiling. The measurement from the ceiling to the blade is 6\" down.\nThe fan has a reverse switch. One for summer to cool down and one for winter to run in reverse and push down the heat.\n\nMy overall impression of the fan was for the price point it is fantastic! It moves a lot of air around and cools down the room. It is not noisy at all. If you are experiencing noise then something is not correct in the installation. I had a loud vibration noise on mine and realized that my light globe was not as tight as it should have been and that fixed the issue. It is completely quiet except for the ambient noise of the fan itself. You could sleep with it on full blast without any issue of noise whatsoever. It is a clean minimalistic design, nothing fancy but again for the price point it does its job well and is just a basic appearance of a standard builder grade fan.\n\nEven though this fan was free it worked so well that I decided to go out the next day and buy a matching one to hang next to it and change out the previous owners' fans. So, in conclusion, I would completely recommend this fan and I would buy it again if I needed too.",

I am a \"good enough\" guy and this fan is not good enough.Google the issue of burning smells coming from many of the cheaper harbor breeze fans, Its a known issue. Many people report going through 2-4 fans before getting one that doesn't stink. Save your heartache and buy a hunter or something even better, the cost difference is minor for a permanent fixture in your home. This fan feels cheap, looks cheap, and even though UL listed has known issues with the motor stinking. I wasted half a day screwing around with junk, I know better but still let my judgement get the best of me. DO NOT BUY!",

            "text": "Picked this fan up because of the low price.  I have purchased and installed well over a dozen ceiling fans over the years.  The installation was easy as all the others.  But when I turned the fan on the first time I was really disappointed in the hum from the motor.  No other fan that I have owned had this bad of a hum.  Many or the reviews complain about this problem.  However, many reviews claim quiet operation.  So maybe it just simply depends on the one you take home.  Anyway, I took the fan down and it went straight to the trash.  Too bad, because I was happy with the look of the fan. So if you want to take a chance that you get a good one, be my guest.",

Not from the blades spinning, but from the motor itself. Turned it off and spun the blades manually. Scrape scrape click click. Yup, the interior of the motor was making the noise with each revolution. Ran it continuously for 48 hours as per the prescribed break-in period (ridiculous). No better. So, I took it down (what a pain) and bought a Hunter for $109. Whisper quiet. Flawless. Perfection. I'll say it again... you get what you pay for. Also, I will never buy the Lowes brand again; it turned me off that much.",

I checked my other 2 Harbor Breeze fans (not builders quality) and another 20 year old fan and none had any humming at any speed, so this is just an extraordinarily cheaply built fan.  In less than 12 hours of use, the motor began scraping against something.  The fan does not push nearly as much air as two 44\" fans I have either.  The glass globe around the bulb looks cheap and while the bulb is a standard E26 base, it is a miniature bulb size.  I returned mine and bought a slightly more expensive 52\" fan.",

            "text": "Whether you're going for the 42 or the 52, these fans do the job of recirculating air in small or medium rooms. Don't buy these for your kitchen or living room, these are perfect for bedrooms or your home office/library.  I wrote up a review on the 52, and my opinion of these has not changed. If your LED bulbs are going out it is because of a loose connection in the lamp holder; likely where you connected the wires at the fixture. If the circuit is not completed as tightly as it should and could be, then electricity may \"arc\" or jump across the contact, rather than simply flowing through it. If your motor is making a noise, you need to make sure that your ceiling is level and that the blade brackets aren't bent in such a way that it's causing it to spin out of balance.  If that doesn't work, you need to exchange the unit; these are flush mount only fan units - they do not have extension components to hang them lower for say 9ft+ ceilings. If the globe breaks, you might not be able to buy one from the manufacturer, but it is an ISO form factor, so go the lighting section at Lowes. You can also put a different style of globe if you find one of the right diameter. If you do this, be aware of the maximum wattage for bulbs which says in the fixture 6.5 watts, that means these are for LED bulbs only with a 60 Watt equivalency; do not put regular bulbs in this as it says not to put anything above 6.5 Watts... If you do and you have problems, it is because you cause them. Also, if you don't have your epilepsy under control via meds, or if LED's give you headaches as they do with some, by a fan that supports 40-60 watt incandescent bulbs.",

The light is bright and the fan moves enough air in this size room. It is amazingly quiet as well. Installation was easy enough. I thought I could reuse the mounting bracket from the larger fan, only to discover AFTER hooking up the wiring, that I could not. Once I started over, the installation went quickly and smoothly. I went with the white fan, rather than more ornate fans, because the dropped ceiling is white and this fan looks good against it. My wife helped me install it, but it could be installed by one person if necessary.",

Despite the noise, I am giving 3 stars anyway - the price is excellent and the fan looks nice.  It does a great job moving the air around.

With my master bath and closet above my garage, they do make a noticable difference. Having them in the garage makes it a lot easier to work on the cars in the summer time.

The assembly and mounting took about 30 minutes total, assembling the blades taking the longest. The fan didn't need any balancing whatsoever (it came with a balancing kit though, in case you need it), it's quiet and works just fine.  I bought 2, one for each spare bedroom.  No issues yet, I'd recommend for a similar setup but not for a large room.  The blades aren't huge, so in a large room you probably wouldn't feel anything from this unit.",

Only tip I have for the someone that either has not does this before or not in a long time....make sure your either write down how the light fixture your replacing was wired or label the supply wires.

It wasn't very safe, so we had to use it on medium or low speed which minimized the wobbling. \nThe Armitage fan was a great choice to replace my old fan. The all white color goes well with my current kitchen color scheme and blends in seamlessly. The whole installation process took about 35 to 45 minutes which included removing the old fan. I made sure the breaker was off before doing anything. I don't need to be a big shot by just turning off the wall switch. All parts and instructions were neatly packed and easy to follow. Take your time and make sure everything is snug at each step to prevent accidents. Once installation was completed, I tested the light and fan which worked really well. The fan is sturdy and quiet. The light was very bright thanks to the provided LED bulb. This will provide efficient lighting that won't need to be replaced for a while. I should note that the one bulb that comes with this fan outshines the 3 little incandescent bulbs on my old fan. This is a good sturdy fan that will go with almost any decor, and provide bright, efficient operation.",

            "text": "Just converted a small bedroom (10 x 10 feet) into an office area and wanted to get some air circulation in the room. Selected this small fan as the color (white) and size (42 inch) seemed a good fit for my space. Received the fan in a surprisingly small box but it was packaged very well. Each painted piece was in it's own plastic bag so all finished areas were well protected so no issues with any scratches or damage. All the parts were in the box and even a few extra screws were included. Did not have a ceiling light in this room so most effort in the process was to mount a fan box and get power to it. Once the wiring was done the fan installation was a snap. Very simple design. I liked the way the hanging bracket was designed to allow hanging the motor while connecting the wiring. Also liked that most screws were installed in brackets so I did not have to search through a large bag of fasteners to find the right ones. Brackets had small rubber pads to avoid metal to metal contact and reduce vibration. The fan does hum, especially at the low speed, which I expected as this is a direct ceiling mount. Good news is that the hum is not is not objectionable and I don't notice it while I am working at my desk. The fan does come with a balance kit if needed but it works fine without it. The finish color is not a bright white but just a bit off white so very compatible with most any ceiling paint. The fan also comes with an LED light bulb that provides a nice bright soft white light so very pleased with the light output. Overall a nicely built little fan with good instructions that was an easy install which added just the right amount of air circulation to the room and is an excellent value. Full disclosure - this fan was provided to me in exchange for an honest review so I have given my unbiased opinon on the features and quality of the product.",
