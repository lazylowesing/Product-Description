Lowe's manager graciously had his truck pick it up even though I hadn't bought the extended warranty (foolish me). It had 4 hours of use on it when it got to John Deere service. I was told only an adjustment was made, but they had they had it 3 months and put 5 more hours of service on it. Deere charged me $54 for a \"mandatory\" 8 hours of run time oil and filter change to keep the warranty. They got it with 4 hours and sent it back with 9 hours. They supposedly ran it more than I did and charged me the $54. and it came back filthy with gravel and dirt everywhere. All this for a minor adjustment.  Lowes yes, Deere No.",

The engine had to be manually turned through the compression stroke to be started. Also second season a blade spindle failed, deck brackets that attach the deck developed cracks and finally snapped off completely. Twice that season the brackets and associated cracks in deck had to be reworked. Which brings us to the beginning of season three. Mower picked up a vibration on first use. Appeared to be another bad spindle but was actually use deck disintegration where the spindle connects. The deck is useless.",

John Deere won't allow Lowes to assemble them, but I am highly pleased with it thus far. It's my first John Deere, the one I had to retire was a Snapper zero turn that was given to me. Only thing I have had to do was drill a small hole in the discharge chute so I can use a strap to hold it up that way it'll fit in my shed. I check the oil everytime I use it, and stays right within the hash marks without having to add any. I love having it, and if ever I'm in the market for another mower, or know anyone needing one, I'll definatly recommend a John Deere.",

The mower rides smooth, cut my mow time by 60 percent and frankly makes me want to mow more than I ever have.  The sales process was a bit frustrating, but par for the course when dealing with Big Box Store staff... delivery was smooth and easy, dropped right off in my driveway. I did have a minor moment of panic as I did a quick inspection, fired it up and tried to move and the machine just sat there, refusing to move in any direction.  Turns out there is a small silver metal bar in the back that you pull out when you want to move the mower without using the mower (pushing it).  The moving guys, aware of this, pulled the pin to push it up my driveway, but left it out and didn't mention to me that this pin existed.  After some quick Google searches, I figured out what was going on and and I was on my way.The seat is comfortable, the drive is easy, turning radius is good, and it's much quieter than I expected.  Overall, I'd say this is a great purchase and has made this middle age dad one happy camper!!",

I decided that a rider would best use of all the time I was loosing pushing that mower. I knew I was either going to go with a Cub Cadet (consumer reports top pick) or John Deere.  I decided to go green...likely because it was green ( I was hoping I didn't make a mistake).  I choose the E130 because it had good power and was highly ranked among consumers.  When I picked up the machine at Lowes, I was immediately concerned because the tank was loose...I wanted to walk until I did some quick research that this was standard on all JD E-Series mowers as it helps with accurate fuel gauge readings...honestly I don't buy it and think it's a horrible R and D flaw...how did anyone in JD marketing (or senior leadership) think that anything loose on a new machine is a good idea?!?!  Outside of the stupid fuel tank/gauge, I absolutely love this machine.  The seat is comfortable, the gauges, controls and PTO are all ergonomically sound.  The cutting quality is top notch and the machine has plenty of power.  In order to cut in reverse you have to mash a yellow button on the console, this is slightly annoying but got used to it at the end of the first day.  I love the deck-wash function and a 30 second oil-filter change is great.  I recently purchased a large dump cart for it and after Hurricane Florence destroyed the area, the cart was loaded with heavy debris...the JD pulled it with ease.  Very happy owner so far...glad I purchase it over the Cub Cadet.",

The Box stores DO NOT add these items. You MUST check these items yourself.The John Deere E130 has a few things that are improvements over the Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48”. Principal among these are the fuel level indicator which is easy to read on JD E130 and nearly impossible to view on Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48”. The Forward and reverse Pedals are easier to use on JD E130, on Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48” the reverse pedal is difficult to operate while seated.First time out on the yard JD E130 ran for 1.5 hours on a tank of fuel. Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48” ran for 2.4 hours on a tank, Got more grass cut in Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48”.JD E130 has 30 second easy oil change filter, $45.00 an oil change, Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48” has the standard spin on filter, $10.00 an oil change.JD E130 has a kit to revert  to the spin on filter for those that think changing all of the oil is beneficial, as opposed to replacing some of the spent oil with a small amount of new oil.JD E130 has a manual PTO to deck lever, Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48” has an electric PTO to deck button.Beyond the above mentioned items the Mowers are remarkably similar.JD E130 was less expensive than Husqvarna V-Twin 24HP / 48” by a few hundred dollars.P.S. First day out in the yard with JD E130 the drive belt for the mower deck broke. $40.00 plus for a belt and $45.00 plus for an “oil change” let me think about that.",

The 22HP engine has more than enough power to put it into high gear and take care of the long grass runs in the back yard. There are separate petals for reverse and forward, and the blade engaging lever is right next to the steering wheel. I love this mower.",

They put the forks under the mower guard for lifting - I'm sure it is not designed to be picked up that way.  Delivery was free, so I guess you get what you pay for with that.  Next, the mower would not start.   The local lowes was receptive to my phone call, and were prepared to swap batteries out, but it was clear that they did not do any pre-delivery check, cleaning or start up.

It has two pedals one for forward and one for backwards and runs and cuts great. Would not want another brand and can not say enough about this tractor except I also love the new gas gauge they put in these. The best place too buy these tractors are at Lowes because they help with everything including filling out the registration and loading it etc. with great customer service. thank you!!!!!!!!!!",

During that time, I used this unit to spread weed killer, fertilizer, irrigate, and thatch my law. It worked GREAT !!! Until it decided, it was done. One week, I tried to start and the motor would not even try to engage; the battery died and the tires flattened, over time. I took it into the local certified dealer to have the warranty work completed, nothing was covered and I had to pay just over $475 to have it fix. Buyer beware, Excellent equipment while it works, expense when it does not. John Deere does not honor their homer obligations ! Kubota maybe my next option is John Deere is unwilling to honor my warranty complaint.",

Felt that overall the e130 was a perfect size and the 22 hp engine was ideal for my yard.  Cuts well and the quick change oil feature is nice, plus grease fittings are not to difficult to get to for maintenance (use JD recommended grease; don't mix grease types).  Pretty good on turn radius and cuts well.  I put on the mulching cover and does well with the 3in1 blades.  Also, spend a couple extra dollars and fill your tractor with the blue handle gas (ethanol free) with some stabilizer. Trust me it will pay off in the long run.",

The Lowes store where I purchased it has terrible phone customer service so I took the belt and the receipt for the mower to see customer service in person.  The girl who was very unsure of what to do gave me a replacement belt.  I put it on according to the users manual but it seemed loose.  I just tried to use it and it slipped off when I engaged the blades.  I'm very disappointed with this “upgrade”. My L115 Automatic's belt tension could be adjusted but no where can I find out to adjust the E130. If I had someway to haul it back to the store right now for a refund, I would!",

I'm thinking about getting a seat cover since that yellow attracts dirt. Remember to go in reverse, you have to hold down the button on the left of the steering wheel then press the right gas pedal.

I have plowed two drives and a 450' x 20' street 4-5 times every winter and have never had a problem with it.I lubed and checked the oil, filters and belts each year and sharpened the blades regularly.If you lube it each year, replace the filters and spark plug regularly, change the oil as directed and are careful with it (hit no ground stakes or large rocks!) it should last at least 8-10 years.I just had mine serviced at a local John Deere dealer, for the first time, and they told me it worked perfectly and only needed normal seasonal maintenance.How many hand or power tools do you own that can be worked that hard and that often and STILL be functioning normally?",

Nothing is worse than getting home from a weekend out of town in July, it's still 90 degrees at 8 PM, and now you have to spend 45 minutes pushing because the grass is out of control! Not any more. I'm mowing twice a week now because I enjoy this tractor so much. Cut my mow time in half. Now on to the details. The 22HP with a 42” deck is a great combo. I knew I wouldn't be happy if the mower were to bog down going up slopes or mowing fast. That's why I went with a  22HP with a 42” deck rather than the 48” deck on the E140. It's more efficient for the motor. The hydrostatic transmission is great- responsive and fast. The turning radius is way better than I expected and the cut is even. I DID have to level the deck myself per the manual as it was not completely level from the store. One 15mm wrench and about 15 minutes and I was up and running. This will vary from store to store as the John Deere's are set up and inspected by local dealers, not Lowes staff. I'm writing this review because you typically only see the complainers posting their headaches.  I picked mine up at the store as I didn't want to wait a week for delivery so I can't rate that experience. The machine is mechanically sound, USA built, and fun to drive.",

I told him i bought the sun shade and the mulcher. He put borh on for me. The sunshade gave us dificulty. The holes didnot line up. He gothis tools and bentThe line up holes so the universal shade attathment could go on. IfOrlando had not been here. I wouldhave sent it back and thought it was defective. He explanded that because it was univeral and was to fit on orher mowers thats why we had extra parts. That we did not use. I am cery pleased with the shade. Next he put on the mulcher. It snaped on. I asked for a quick driving lesson. He did. I was able to back up, and cut grass. He shiwed me the sequence of clutch, turn key, throttle up for fast or diwn toshut it off. The 2 peddles, forward and backward. If i got off the seat. The mower would shut down. I learned the sequence to lower throtle and turn the key first, then get off.

My son showed me to turn the black part counter clockwise and the green part turn it to the right. It was hard to do. I had to repeat this sequence alot before the hose was on. I let my son start the mower and blades to clean under the deck. It had worked very good. I finished with the jet setting on my hose sprayer the grass i could see on the deck and mulcher.

A couple of things missing from the owners manual; fuel gauge is attached/part of the fuel tank. More fuel the tank, the more the tank tips to move the gauge towards the full mark. The fuel tank does float. Doesn't clearly state that you have to physically move the parking brake down to disengage. Figured it out and love this mower.",

When delivery time came and I went to test start  there was  nothing....the delivery staff and I assumed it was a \"safety feature\" preventing it from turning over.  After a while of debugging in that direction we noticed that the lights would not turn on which caused us to switch focus to the battery.  The battery cables were installed but very loosely.  Not good but after getting a voltmeter realized the loose cables weren't the only issue as the battery was completely dead.  As I was travelling the following week we got to use our push mower an extra week while we waited for a replacement battery.  We need the exercise but that was not the plan.   Fast forward to a week later when I can actually use the tractor and realize the cutting is a bit un-level.  Looking at the decks anti-scalp wheels and noticed that one was in the highest mounting hole the other side had the wheels on near the lowest.  Possibly another issue with the John Deere pre-delivery Quality Control.  Barely have used the tractor but so far things aren't boding well for John Deere quality.",

PS: try to avoid the yard tractor that has a fuel filler and tank in front over the engine. That could be a fire hazard. John Deere does not seem to do this on any of their riding lawn mowers. I would think this should be disapproved by OSHA as unsafe. So, stick with safety, stick with John Deere.",

Whoever assembled it did not put the pins in and had to look at several mowers before finding one that did have the pins. After filling the tank and charging thw battery the mower would not even attempt to start. After messing with it for way to long finally returned it for another one. Brought fuel with me this time and started it in the parking lot to make sure i wasnt getting another dud. Then after getting the second one home i realized it was missing the compartment lid. Went back and got one from lowes. To be fair the lowes employess have been helpful but the mower is not off to a good start and makes me have my doubts on its longevity.",

            "text": "Let me say at the outset that I have never written a review.  However, I read numerous reviews in my research on which riding lawnmower to purchase and from where.  So, I felt compelled to write my own review.  First, this is my first riding lawnmower after many years of using a self propelled Honda.  The Honda was, and is, a great machine but it was high time to switch to a rider.  Wow!  I have only cut my grass once but it was fun!!  My John Deere exceeded my expectations and worked as well as the best review on here said it would.  It is easy to learn how to operate and does everything I hoped it would do.  I have neighbors that have recently decided to move and take a job in another state....Too bad because I would offer to cut their grass for free just to continue riding this lawnmower!!!  Perhaps the most important part of this review is to thank Don from Lowe's who delivered the mower to my house.  He was super nice and asked me if this was my first riding mower.  I said yes, but that I thought I was prepared as I had done a lot of research.  He asked if I would still like him to give me a quick tutorial.  I'm glad I said yes, even though I was pretty much ready.  He went over all the details of operation without \"talking down\" to me and made me feel very comfortable.  He made sure everything was operational and up to speed before he left.  Simply put, best customer service from Lowe's that I've ever received.  Great buy and great service.  You can't beat that!!!!  Oh yes, by the way, I ordered the mower on a Friday and received it delivered the very next Tuesday just as Lowe's told me it would.  Awesome!",

I'm left with the choice of not using the parking brake, losing the use of the mower while it is being repaired by the dealer or expended the effort to troubleshoot and repair it myself on a 0 hour mower supposedly ready to use.The operator's manual contains no part numbers/type/specification for replacement spark plugs, air filter or fuel filter.  Only fuel, oil and grease are specified. The Lowe's, John Deere and Briggs & Stratton websites are no help either.While there are several things I like about this mower, the poorly designed parking brake, the incomplete information in the operator's manual and the use of flimsy plastic for body panels and controls have caused me to regret my choice of a John Deere mower.

Quality is good, the mower works well as does the bagger.  I will also purchase a snow blade--although reviews don't seem to be as high for it.  I will consider optional blades--but probably by the JD.  Big problem was the manual, as many have mentioned.  Not a big problem though.  No missing parts.  I drove the tractor around for 1 hour before mowing.  The mower made a lot of noise.  I assumed it needed to be broken in.  Watching videos on YouTube I watched one that said JD did not grease the mower deck but did grease the tractor.  I took off the deck and found that to be true.  AFter reassembly I cut a little of the lawn again and it was so quiet that I could not tell if it was working.  Grass in the hopper told the story.  SO-- grease the mower deck before using.  That is the only thing that I am dissatisfied with.  (And the quality of the manuals.--what would help are a few exploded views in the assembly instructions.). The bagger was a puzzle and the manual was almost worthless.  A picture is worth a thousand words!!!  Perhaps the manuals were written by some Chinese guy sitting in Beijing.  (Not really--JD lawn tractors are made in the USA, at least if the labels on the tractor are true.)",

In addition to the annual oil and filter changes I've had to have the steering mechanism repaired twice, and had to have a new head gasket installed on the motor (evidently a common problem according to the JD mechanic). It's also gone through several drive belts and a couple sets of pulley covers on the deck because theJD engineers designed the guard such trhat it continually rubs on the belt.  Two years ago part of the deck broke off and I had to have it welded back on. Just this week the deck literally broke and I had to have it replaced to the tune of $775.  I have as much in repairs in this machine as the original purchase price.  I mow about two acres of lawn with it.  I've talked to John Deere and they admit that the models they sell through the big box stores are engineered to have less cost in them than the ones sold through the Deere stores.

I am not sure if this is a design flaw or something that can be adjusted. Since I was within the 30-day guarantee I was able to return it to Lowe's and when I looked at the same mower at the store I noticed that as soon as I would hit a bump on my property the same scenario would occur. Therefore I decided to return it to Lowe's. On a lot of my cutting I would have to put it on the highest cutting level which in essence would move the mower deck really close to the mower deck belt. I can very easily see how I could be in the same situation. As for the operation of the mower itself it was awesome. I have about a 9% slope and this mower had no difficulty going up and down. I know I have read where mower deck belts were breaking and I'm not sure if it is because they are rubbing on top of the mower deck like mine was. If you have a yard that you will be cutting very close to the ground your mower deck belt will not come in contact most likely with the mower deck. I felt the ride was smooth even for my bumpy terrain. I know that this is not just my terrain because I had a Craftsman mower here for many years and never had any problem with the mower deck belt creating a groove in top of the mower deck. There was a place where you can lower the deck possibly maybe an inch if that however I was too afraid to take a chance that a bump would bounce the mower deck back up and rub against the belt. Unfortunately I am not able to have the John Deere I've always wanted.",

            "text": "Everyone has been through the routine... \"What do I buy concerning mowers.\" There are the red ones, yellow ones, orange ones, and green ones...then comes sticker shock. \"Oh my goodness, WHAT!?!?\" So then the \"analysis and assessment\" sets in for the next two years as one hopes to find the perfect deal. Right? I knew that Craftsman may be on the outs which had been a mainstay in the lawn and tool world. Been there done that. Then the Husky is considered... which is a really close match with the Deere. So what to do? Buy American! So, I bought the E130 John Deere and am VERY HAPPY with my purchase. The E-130 differs only primarily with the E-140 is the smaller blade cutting width (42 inch vs. 48 inch); however, the transmission is the same in both models. (More wear and tear on the bigger cutting platform). I'm very impressed and happy with the operation and comfort this E-130 affords; but, knowing John Deere's Customer Service for maintenance is going to be a \"touch-n-go process\" and the \"FREE-FLOATING\" gas tank that Deere uses causes me to give an overall rating of 4 stars to an otherwise 5 star thumbs-up for this Yard Maestro. (The 42 inch mower also offers a smaller footprint in the storage building). IF one is able to DOUBLE-CHECK bolts, nuts, clips, mower adjustments, follow prescribed maintenance routines with oil changes, fuel stabilizers, greasing before and after use... and take good care of the equipment, the Deere should meet the noble commands with class and satisfaction. (I purchased the extended warranty for additional peace-of-mind). A casual study of our lawn-care professionals provides some good clues in narrowing ones field of lawn equipment choices as it did for me. Love, my Deere.",

I am so happy with this purchase.  I had made my way around dealers and I ended up buying from Lowes online.  This was a seamless purchase. The people were great and very helpful especially while loading it on my trailer.   I brought it home and conected the battery etc and the engine started right up and has the power I need.  I have a big hill in the front of my house. I chose the E130 for the 22hp motor and the manual lever to engage the blades because my electric pto didn't always want to engage on my last mower.I added the bagger acccessory because my yard and neighbors yards have a ton of trees.  I found that the bagger was easy for me to install. The deck has to come off for installation and that comes off pretty easy too with if I remember right, six cotter pins and washers. I looked at many other brands and for me this seemed the best fit, partly because you can get some items for maintenance at Lowes and other retail stores.",

Had an LA125 before and put that one through a lot and it's still going. I'm not understanding the previous comment about the safety features. You can engage the parking brake and it'll keep running while when you're off the machine, provided the blade is not engaged. Anyone that has been around equipment knows that. It mows clean, has plenty of power and is easy to maintain. I know some people dislike the 30 second oil change, but that's more than what most people do and it's easy to swap it out and go back to a traditional setup. John Deere is expensive compared to others but the implement delivered it to me the next day, all set up and ready to go. It's worth it to buy from a reputable dealer.",

            "text": "Mows well in yard grass. \n\nDid not handle tall pasture grass that grew while we looked for a new mower after the old one died (after 25 years). Our old Garden Tractor would have, but I would have been able to do it with a deck that I could lift above the normal 4 inch highest mowing position for the first cut, then do it again at mower level. I wish this mower had that ability. \n\nIt is almost impossible for an old lady, me, to push the brake/clutch in adequately in order to start it. In another 5 years it will probably be impossible for me to do. It seems like it is all the way in, does not move any farther, but only after pressing even harder will the mower start. \n\nAs for \"expertise,\" I've been operating farm equipment all of my life, and riding mowers for the last 30 years. I know you have to really press on the clutch to start, but this is ridiculous. I can't stand on it because you have to keep sitting on the seat. We got this because we are too old to push a mower over 2 acres and need something old people can handle. FYI I'm 75 and plan to mow my own lawn for a long time to come. There should be some way around this.\n\nThere's something else that is inconvenient. The mower dies if you get off the seat to remove an obstacle, even if the blade is not running. Then you have to go through the whole starting exercise all over again. Safety features have gone a bit overboard.",
