Every Hunter fan that I have owned has preformed wonderfully, this is the first time I haven't been completely satisfied with one. It's a very nice looking fan, with a simple installation. The issue that I have with the fan is that the light is an integrated LED light that can not be replaced with a brighter light. The light output is poor possibly due to the light LEDs or the heavily frosted cover on it. Either way I'm very disappointed with the lighting from the fan, so I'll be returning it. Im still in the market for a new ceiling fan, Lowes and Hunter will still be an option.",

I've tried several times to sync the remote to the fan via the hidden sync button underneath the remote control battery door. Replaced the new battery with another new battery. Turned the light switch on and off several times. No luck. Occasionally, the light button on the remote will turn the light on, but it's very sporadic! It's very frustrating, because the fan looks awesome. I just need the remote to be able to turn the light on and off when I push the button. If Hunter can make that happen, that would be great!",

After research on line, i had to contact Hunter Fan customer support for the pairing instructions as it didn't appear on line.  Still could not get fans to pair after they emailed instructions.  Contacted customer support again and they asked me to send them a picture of the remote as the model was so new.  Got another set of instructions, and still could not get either fan to pair with either remote.  Called HF Customer support and they were able to give me another set of instructions.   Still no avail.  i even rewired both fans to make sure connections were good.   Finally call ed HF once again and they went through wiring just to double check.  They finally admitted the transmitters must be bad.  Sent me two new ones, popped them in, and both fans paired up just fine.  Bottom line is if you have trouble pairing your remote...CALL and ask for new transmitter.   Otherwise the fan looks great.  Light output is dim at first, but if you hold the dimming switch as instructed it actually dims down and then brighter.",

Can't get the light to dim via remote or otherwise.  So I can see other reviews where the light was too dim and can't get it brighter. \n Might be the opposite symptom I have but probably result in same fix (i.e. figure out the remote buttons beyond the printed cheat sheet with it).",
