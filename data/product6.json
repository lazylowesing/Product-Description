I put two coats and its the brightest white you will ever find and i smudged the cabinent doors when i hung them back up and i took a damp cloth wiped it right off. I love it and its cheaper than the cabinent paint. I still havent finished it. Putting down new flooring tomorrow and hadnt finished putting all the cabinent hardware on.  I give it a 5 star.
