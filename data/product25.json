I could live with that, as I planned to place a table runner over it anyway.  However, it's definitely not 100% cotton.  The package doesn't list the material content, but it's quite stretchy, as if it contains spandex.  Whatever the content, it shrank unevenly after machine washing and drying.  And make no mistake, it DOES shrink.  Even after meticulous ironing, it is warped, mis-shapen and puckery in places.  It looks like there are 12-inch wide bands of elastic woven into it, causing it to draw up unevenly.  It won't lay flat for anything.  This also causes the hem line to slant.  So if you're looking to decorate with this, keep looking.  It might work for curtains, where the uneven shape could be disguised in the folds.  But if you need it to lay flat, this one gets a big fat, \"NO\" vote.  I may use it to make slipcovers for some throw pillows.",
