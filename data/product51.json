            "text": "This saw appears to be a solid workhorse. Compared it to my old standard (Craftsman Industrial); see photo. This saw is a full 3 pounds lighter (10.0 for the Hitachi vs. 13.1 for the Craftsman), plus adds in a couple amps (15 vs. 13) of power.\n\nTested out a crosscut, and it's dead on the cut line tracking with the saw base notch. Also did a 45 degree miter, and it too was accurate compared to my square. Only minor squawk is that the cord is a bit short (six feet vs. nine). Also would have been nice to have the included 24T blade already loaded, but that was easily fixed. I like the hex key vs. socket wrench approach to clamping the blade. Last little nit is that the plug does not have a notch to clamp on the cord, but overall an outstanding saw that should get plenty of use.",

I really like it. Grips are very user friendly.\nI like the five year warranty!",

The only issue I have (why I gave it 4 stars) is the saw did not come with the wing nut and spring for a guide rail. I knew the saw didn't come with the guide rail and I figured I'd purchase an aftermarket one. But there was nothing to secure the rail, so I had to jump through a bunch of hoops and order the proper wing nut and spring from Hitachi. Hitachi needs to include that piece. Otherwise the saw itself is outstanding.",

            "text": "This is a great saw. It is well balanced and low profile (not top-heavy at all). The grips are very comfortable, and the trigger has a great, solid, smooth, built-to-last feel. The blade guard is extremely smooth; I can't feel it moving when I enter the wood even if I try.The foot is 1/16\" thick: plenty strong. The plastic housing is very high quality molded plastic (I think). It actually almost looks like fiberglass, but it's not. The blade guard is metal, I'm not sure what kind, but it is plenty strong enough. Not that I would recommend it, but this saw feels like it could be dropped a good deal, and not suffer much damage.Now for the features. It has the externally accessible carbon brushes (the next-best thing to brushless, without the price). The Dust blower really does help a lot with being able to see the line on long cuts. I wasn't sure about the spindle lock, because I had one break on me once, and then it was a real pain to get the blade off, but I don't think that this one will break. The bevel adjusters are very nice, large levers that are easy to use, but don't really get in the way. Get the case with it if you can: it is really well designed, and will protect the saw well. It fits nice and snugly.All in all, a great saw, with sturdy durability, convenient features, and at a low price.",
